=head1 Name

sqitch-verify - Verify deployed database changes

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] verify [<database>]
  sqitch [options] verify --from-change <change>
  sqitch [options] verify --to-change <change>
  sqitch [options] verify --from-change <change> --to-change <change>

=head1 Description

Verify that a database is valid relative to the plan and the verification
scripts for each deployed change.

More specifically, C<verify> iterates over all deployed and planned changes
(or the subset identified by C<--from-change> and/or C<--to-change>) and
checks that each:

=over

=item *

Is deployed.

=item *

Is present in the plan.

=item *

Was deployed in the proper order.

=item *

Passes its verify test, if one exists and the change has not been reworked.

=back

The C<< <database> >> parameter specifies the database to which to connect,
and may also be specified as the C<--target> option. It can be target name,
a URI, an engine name, or plan file path.

Verify tests are scripts that may be associated with each change. If a change
has no verify script, a warning is emitted, but it is not considered a
failure. If a change has been reworked, only the most recent reworking will
have its verify script executed.

Verify scripts should make no assumptions about the contents of the database,
as unit tests might. Rather, their job is to ensure that the state of a
database is correct after a deploy script has completed. Verify scripts are
run through the database engine command-line client, just like deploy and
revert scripts. They should cause the client to exit with a non-zero exit code
if they fail.

=head1 Options

=over

=item C<-t>

=item C<--target>

The target database to which to connect. This option can be either a URI or
the name of a target in the configuration.

=item C<--from-change>

=item C<--from>

Specify the change with which to start the verification. Defaults to the
earliest deployed change. See L<sqitchchanges> for the various ways in which
changes can be specified.

=item C<--to-change>

=item C<--to>

Specify the change with which to complete the verification. Defaults to the
last deployed change. See L<sqitchchanges> for the various ways in which
changes can be specified.

=item C<-s>

=item C<--set>

Set a variable name and value for use by the database engine client, if it
supports variables. The format must be C<name=value>, e.g.,
C<--set defuser='Homer Simpson'>. Overrides any values loaded from the
C<verify.variables> configuration.

=back

=head1 Configuration Variables

=over

=item C<[verify.variables]>

A section defining database client variables. Useful if your database engine
supports variables in scripts, such as PostgreSQL's
L<C<psql> variables|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-INTERPOLATION>,
Vertica's
L<C<vsql> variables|http://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/ConnectingToHPVertica/vsql/Variables.htm>,
MySQL's
L<user variables|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/user-variables.html>,
and SQL*Plus's
L<C<DEFINE> variables|http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/ch12017.htm>.
