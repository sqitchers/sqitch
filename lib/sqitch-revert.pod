sqitch-revert - Revert changes to a database

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] revert [<database>]
  sqitch [options] revert [<database>] <change>
  sqitch [options] revert [<database>] --to-change <change>

=head1 Description

Revert changes to the database. Starting from the current deployment state,
changes will be reverted in reverse the order of application. All changes will
be reverted unless a change is specified, either via C<--to> or with no option
flag, in which case changes will be reverted back to that change.

If the database has not been deployed to, or its state already matches the
specified change, no changes will be made. If the change appears later in the
plan than the currently-deployed state, an error will be returned, along with
a suggestion to instead use L<sqitch-deploy>.

The C<< <database> >> parameter specifies the database to which to connect,
and may also be specified as the C<--target> option. It can be either a URI or
the name of a target in the configuration.

=over

=item C<[deploy.variables]>

=item C<[revert.variables]>

A section defining database client variables. The C<deploy.variables>
configuration is read from the C<deploy> command configuration, on the
assumption that the values will generally be the same. If they're not, use
C<revert.variables> to override C<deploy.variables>.

These variables are Useful if your database engine supports variables in
scripts, such as PostgreSQL's
L<C<psql> variables|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-INTERPOLATION>
and SQL*Plus's
L<C<DEFINE> variables|http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/ch12017.htm>.
