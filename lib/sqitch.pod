sqitch - Sane database change management

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [<options>] <command> [<command-options>] [<args>]

=head1 Description

Sqitch is a database change management application. What makes it different
from your typical L<migration|Module::Build::DB>-L<style|DBIx::Migration>
approaches? A few things:

=over

=item No opinions

Sqitch is not integrated with any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it is a
standalone change management system with no opinions on your database or
development choices.

=item Native scripting

Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database engine.
Writing a L<PostgreSQL|http://postgresql.org/> application? Write SQL scripts
for L<C<psql>|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html>.
Writing a L<MySQL|http://mysql.com/>-backed app? Write SQL scripts for
L<C<mysql>|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html>.

=begin comment

=item VCS integration

Sqitch likes to use your VCS history to determine in what order to execute
changes. No need to keep track of execution order; your VCS already tracks
information sufficient for Sqitch to figure it out for you.

=end comment

=item Dependency resolution

Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes. This ensures
proper order of execution, even when you've committed changes to your VCS
out-of-order.

=item No numbering

Change deployment is managed by maintaining a plan file. As such, there is no
need to number your changes, although you can if you want. Sqitch doesn't much
care how you name your changes.

=begin comment

=item Bundling

Rely on your VCS history for deployment but have Sqitch bundle up changes for
distribution. Sqitch can read your VCS history and write out a plan file along
with the appropriate deployment and reversion scripts. Once the bundle is
installed on a new system, Sqitch can use the plan file to deploy or the
changes in the proper order.

=item Reduced Duplication

If you're using a VCS to track your changes, you don't have to duplicate
entire change scripts for simple changes. As long as the changes are
L<idempotent|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence>, you can change
your code directly, and Sqitch will know it needs to be updated.

=head2 Terminology

=over

=item C<change>

A named unit of change. A change name must be used in the file names of its
deployment and a reversion scripts. It may also be used in a test script file
name.

=item C<tag>

A known deployment state, pointing to a single change, typically corresponding
to a release. Think of it is a version number or VCS revision. A given point
in the plan may have any number of tags.

=item C<state>

The current state of the database. This is represented by the most
recently-deployed change. If the state of the database is the same as the most
recent change, then it is considered "up-to-date".

=item C<plan>

A list of one or more changes and their dependencies that define the order of
deployment execution. The plan is stored in a "plan file," usually named
F<sqitch.plan>. Sqitch reads the plan file to determine what changes to
execute to change the database from one state to another.

=item C<add>

The act of adding a change to the plan. Sqitch will generate scripts for the
change, which you then may modify with the necessary code (typically DDLs) to
actually make, revert, and test the change.

=item C<deploy>

The act of deploying changes to a database. Sqitch reads the plan, checks the
current state of the database, and applies all the changes necessary to either
bring the database up-to-date or to a requested state (a change name or tag).

=item C<revert>

The act of reverting database changes to reach an earlier deployment state.
Sqitch reads the list of deployed changes from the database and reverts
them in the reverse of the order in which they were applied. All changes
may be reverted, or changes may be reverted to a requested state (a change
name or tag).

=item C<committer>

User who commits or reverts changes to a database.

C<test> directories will be written to it. Defaults to "bundle". Property
name: C<bundle.destdir>.

=back

=item L<C<help>|sqitch-help>

Show help for a specific command or, if no command is specified, show the same
documentation as C<--help>.

=back

=head1 Configuration

Sqitch configuration can be set up on a project, user, or system-wide basis.
The format of the configuration file, named F<sqitch.conf>, is the same as for
L<git>.

Here's an example of a configuration file that might be useful checked into a
VCS for a project that deploys to PostgreSQL and stores its deployment scripts
with the extension F<ddl> under the C<migrations> directory. It also wants
bundle to be created in the F<_build/sql> directory, and to deploy starting
with the "gamma" tag:

  [core]
      uri       = https://github.com/theory/sqitch/
      engine    = pg
      db        = widgetopolis
      top_dir   = migrations
      extension = ddl

  [revert]
      to        = gamma

  [bundle]
      from      = gamma
      tags_only = yes
      dest_dir  = _build/sql

And here's an example of useful configuration in F<~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf>, to
point to system-specific engine information:

  [core.pg]
      client    = /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql
      username  = theory

  [core.mysql]
      client    = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
      username  = root

  [core.sqlite]
      client    = /usr/local/bin/sqlite3

Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation
accordingly. See L<sqitch-config> for a list.
