sqitch - Sane database change management

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [<options>] <command> [<command-options>] [<args>]

=head1 Description

Sqitch is a database change management application. What makes it different
from your typical L<migration|Module::Build::DB>-L<style|DBIx::Migration>
approaches? A few things:

=over

=item No opinions

Sqitch is not integrated with any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it is a
standalone change management system with no opinions about your database
engine, application framework, or your development environment.

=item Native scripting

Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database engine.
Writing a L<PostgreSQL|http://postgresql.org/> application? Write SQL scripts
for L<C<psql>|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html>.
Writing a L<MySQL|http://mysql.com/>-backed app? Write SQL scripts for
L<C<mysql>|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html>.

=begin comment

=item VCS integration

Sqitch likes to use your VCS history to determine in what order to execute
changes. No need to keep track of execution order; your VCS already tracks
information sufficient for Sqitch to figure it out for you.

=end comment

=item Dependency resolution

Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes -- even on changes
from other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of execution, even when
you've committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.

=item No numbering

Change deployment is managed by maintaining a plan file. As such, there is no
need to number your changes, although you can if you want. Sqitch doesn't much
care how you name your changes.

=item Iterative Development

Up until you tag and release your application, you can modify your change
deployment scripts as often as you like. They're not locked in just because
they've been committed to your VCS. This allows you to take an iterative
approach to developing your database schema. Or, better, you can do
test-driven database development.

=begin comment

=item Bundling

Rely on your VCS history for deployment but have Sqitch bundle up changes for
distribution. Sqitch can read your VCS history and write out a plan file along
with the appropriate deployment and reversion scripts. Once the bundle is
installed on a new system, Sqitch can use the plan file to deploy or the
changes in the proper order.

=item Reduced Duplication

If you're using a VCS to track your changes, you don't have to duplicate
entire change scripts for simple changes. As long as the changes are
L<idempotent|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence>, you can change
your code directly, and Sqitch will know it needs to be updated.

=head2 Terminology

=over

=item C<change>

A named unit of change. A change name must be used in the file names of its
deploy and a revert scripts. It may also be used in a verify script file
name.

=item C<tag>

A known deployment state, pointing to a single change, typically corresponding
to a release. Think of it is a version number or VCS revision. A given point
in the plan may have any number of tags.

=item C<state>

The current state of the database. This is represented by the most
recently-deployed change. If the state of the database is the same as the most
recent change, then it is considered "up-to-date".

=item C<plan>

A list of one or more changes and their dependencies that define the order of
deployment execution. The plan is stored in a "plan file," usually named
F<sqitch.plan>. Sqitch reads the plan file to determine what changes to
execute to change the database from one state to another.

=item C<add>

The act of adding a change to the plan. Sqitch will generate scripts for the
change, which you then may modify with the necessary code (typically DDLs) to
actually deploy, revert, and verify the change.

=item C<deploy>

The act of deploying changes to a database. Sqitch reads the plan, checks the
current state of the database, and applies all the changes necessary to either
bring the database up-to-date or to a requested state (a change name or tag).

=item C<revert>

The act of reverting database changes to reach an earlier deployment state.
Sqitch reads the list of deployed changes from the database and reverts
them in the reverse of the order in which they were applied. All changes
may be reverted, or changes may be reverted to a requested state (a change
name or tag).

=item C<committer>

User who commits or reverts changes to a database.

=item C<planner>

User who adds a change to the plan.

=head1 Sqitch Commands

=over

=item L<C<init>|sqitch-init>

Create the plan file and directories for deploy, revert, and verify scripts if
they do not already exist. This command is useful for starting a new Sqitch
project.

=item L<C<status>|sqitch-status>

Output information about the current deployment state of a database, including
the name of the last deployed change, as well as any tags applied to it. If
any changes in the plan have not been deployed, they will be listed
separately.

=item L<C<log>|sqitch-log>

Search and Output the complete change history of a database. Provides
information about when changes were deployed, reverted, or failed, as well as
who planned and committed the changes, and when.

=item C<plan>

*Not yet implemented.

Search and output the list of changes in the plan.

=item C<check>

*Not yet implemented.

Sanity check the deployment scripts. Checks include:

=over

=item *

Make sure all deploy scripts have complementary revert scripts.

=back

=item L<C<add>|sqitch-add>

Add a new change.

=item L<C<tag>|sqitch-tag>

List tags or tag the latest change.

=item L<C<rework>|sqitch-rework>

Rework an existing change.

=item L<C<deploy>|sqitch-deploy>

Deploy changes.

=item L<C<revert>|sqitch-revert>

Revert changes.

=item C<verify>

*Not yet implemented.

Verify changes. All SQL scripts in C<--verify-dir> will be run. [XXX Not sure
whether to have subdirectories for verifys and expected output and to diff
them, or to use some other approach.]

=item L<C<config>|sqitch-config>

Get and set project, user, or system Sqitch options.

=item C<bundle>

Bundle a Sqitch project for distribution. This command copies the Sqitch
configuration, plan, and deploy, revert, and verify scripts to a directory, so
that it can be packaged up for distribution, such as in an RPM or tarball.

=item L<C<help>|sqitch-help>

Show help for a specific command or, if no command is specified, show the same
documentation as C<--help>.

=back

=head1 Configuration

Sqitch configuration can be set up on a project, user, or system-wide basis.
The format of the configuration file, named F<sqitch.conf>, is the same as for
L<git>.

Here's an example of a configuration file that might be useful checked into a
VCS for a project that deploys to PostgreSQL and stores its deployment scripts
with the extension F<ddl> under the C<migrations> directory. It also wants
bundle to be created in the F<_build/sql> directory, and to deploy starting
with the "gamma" tag:

  [core]
      engine    = pg
      top_dir   = migrations
      extension = ddl

  [core "pg"]
      db_name   = widgetopolis

  [revert]
      to        = gamma

  [bundle]
      from      = gamma
      tags_only = yes
      dest_dir  = _build/sql

And here's an example of useful configuration in F<~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf>, to
point to system-specific engine information:

  [user]
      name      = Marge N. O’Vera
      email     = marge@example.com

  [core "pg"]
      client    = /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql
      username  = theory

  [core.mysql]
      client    = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
      username  = root

  [core.sqlite]
      client    = /usr/local/bin/sqlite3

Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation
accordingly. See L<sqitch-config> for a list.
