sqitch-environment - Environment variables recognized by Sqitch

=head1 Description

Sqitch supports a number of environment variables that affect its
functionality. This document lists them all, along with brief descriptions of
their purposes and pointers to relevant documentation.

=over

=item C<SQITCH_CONFIG>

Path to the project configuration file. Overrides the default, which is
F<./sqitch.conf>. See L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_USER_CONFIG>

Path to the user's configuration file. Overrides the default, which is
F<./.sqitch/sqitch.conf>. See L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_SYSTEM_CONFIG>

Path to the system's configuration file. Overrides the default, which is a
file named C<sqitch.conf> in the directory identified by C<sqitch --etc>. See
L<sqitch-config> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_PASSWORD>

Password to use when connecting to a database, for those database engines that
support it. See L<sqitch-passwords> for details.

=item C<SQITCH_EDITOR>

The editor that Sqitch will launch when the user needs to edit some text (a
change note, for example). If unset, the C<core.editor> configuration variable
will be used. If it's not set, C<$VISUAL> or C<$EDITOR> will be consulted (in
that order).  Finally, if none of these are set, Sqitch will invoke
C<notepad.exe> on Windows and C<vi> elsewhere.
