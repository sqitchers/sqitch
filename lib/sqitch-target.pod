=head1 Description

Manage the set of databases ("targets") you deploy to. Each target may have a
number of properties:

=over

=item C<uri>

The L<database connection URI|URI::db> for the target. Required. Its format is:

  db:engine:[dbname]
  db:engine:[//[user[:password]@][host][:port]/][dbname][?params][#fragment]

Some examples:

=over

=item C<db:sqlite:widgets.db>

=item C<db:pg://dba@example.net/blanket>

=item C<db:mysql://db.example.com/>

=item C<db:firebird://localhost//tmp/test.fdb>

=back

See the L<DB URI Draft|https://github.com/theory/uri-db> for details.

=item C<registry>

The name of the registry schema or database. The default is C<sqitch>.

=item C<client>

The command-line client to use. If not specified, each engine looks in the OS
Path for an appropriate client.

=item C<top_dir>

The path to the top directory for the target. This directory generally
contains the plan file and subdirectories for deploy, revert, and verify
scripts, as well as reworked instances of those scripts. The default is F<.>,
the current directory.

=item C<plan_file>

The plan file to use for this target. The default is C<$top_dir/sqitch.plan>.

=item C<deploy_dir>

The path to the deploy directory for the target. This directory contains all
of the deploy scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/deploy>.

=item C<revert_dir>

The path to the revert directory for the target. This directory contains all
of the revert scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/revert>.

=item C<verify_dir>

The path to the verify directory for the target. This directory contains all
of the verify scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/verify>.

=item C<reworked_dir>

The path to the reworked directory for the target. This directory contains all
subdirectories for all reworked scripts referenced by changes in the
C<plan_file>. The default is C<$top_dir>.

=item C<reworked_deploy_dir>

The path to the reworked deploy directory for the target. This directory
contains all of the reworked deploy scripts referenced by changes in the
C<plan_file>. The default is C<$reworked_dir/deploy>.

=item C<reworked_revert_dir>

The path to the reworked revert directory for the target. This directory
contains all of the reworked revert scripts referenced by changes in the
C<plan_file>. The default is C<$reworked_dir/revert>.

=item C<reworked_verify_dir>

The path to the reworked verify directory for the target. This directory
contains all of the reworked verify scripts referenced by changes in the
C<plan_file>. The default is C<$reworked_dir/verify>.

=item C<extension>

The file name extension to append to change names to create script file names.
The default is C<sql>.

=back

Each of these overrides the corresponding engine-specific configuration
managed by L<engine|sqitch-engine>.

=head1 Options

=item List Option

=over

=item C<-v>

=item C<--verbose>

Specifies the top directory to use for the target. Typically contains the
deployment plan file and the change script directories.

=item C<--plan-file>

  sqitch target add devwidgets --plan-file my.plan

Specifies the path to the deployment plan file. Defaults to
C<$top_dir/sqitch.plan>.

=item C<--extension>

  sqitch target add devwidgets --extension ddl

Specifies the file name extension to use for change script file names.
Defaults to C<sql>.

=item C<--dir>

  sqitch target add devwidgets --dir deploy=dep --dir revert=rev --dir verify=tst

Sets the path to a script directory. May be specified multiple times.
Supported keys are:

=over

=item * C<deploy>

=item * C<revert>

=item * C<verify>

=item * C<reworked>

=item * C<reworked_deploy>

=item * C<reworked_revert>

=item * C<reworked_verify>

=back

=item C<--registry>

  sqitch target add devwidgets --registry meta
  
Specifies the name of the database object where Sqitch's state and history
data is stored. Typically a schema name (as in PostgreSQL and Oracle) or a

=head1 Actions

With no arguments, shows a list of existing targets. Several actions are
available to perform operations on the targets.

=head2 C<add>

Add a target named C<< <name> >> for the database at C<< <uri> >>. The
C<--set> option specifies target-specific properties. A new plan file and new
script script directories will be created if they don't already exist.

=head2 C<alter>

Alter target named C<< <name> >>. The C<--set> option specifies
engine-specific properties to set. New script script directories will be
created if they don't already exist.

=head2 C<remove>, C<rm>

Remove the target named C<< <name> >>. The plan file and script directories
will not be affected.

=head2 C<rename>

Rename the target named C<< <old> >> to C<< <new> >>.

=head2 C<show>

Gives some information about the target C<< <name> >>, including the
associated properties. Specify multiple target names to see information for
each.

=head1 Configuration Variables

The targets are stored in the configuration file, but the command itself
currently relies on no configuration variables.

=head1 Sqitch

Part of the L<sqitch> suite.
