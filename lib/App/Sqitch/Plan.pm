=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Plan - Sqitch Deployment Plan

=head1 Synopsis

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan->new( file => $file );
  while (my $tag = $plan->next) {
      say "Deploy ", join' ', @{ $tag->names };
  }

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Plan provides the interface for a Sqitch plan. It parses a plan
file and provides an iteration interface for working with the plan.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Plan object.

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<sqitch>

  my $sqitch = $cmd->sqitch;

Returns the L<App::Sqitch> object that instantiated the plan.

=head3 C<position>

Returns the current position of the iterator. This is an integer that's used
as an index into plan. If C<next()> has not been called, or if C<reset()> has
been called, the value will be -1, meaning it is outside of the plan. When
C<next> returns C<undef>, the value will be the last index in the plan plus
1.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<seek>

  $plan->seek($tag_name);

Move the plan position to the specified tag. Dies if the tag cannot be found
in the plan.

=head3 C<reset>

   $plan->reset;

Resets iteration. Same as C<$plan->position(-1)>, but better.

=head3 C<next>

  while (my $tag = $plan->next) {
      say "Deploy ", join' ', @{ $tag->names };
  }

Returns the next L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> in the plan. Returns C<undef> if
there are no more tags.

=head3 C<current>

   my $tag = $plan->current;

Returns the same tag as was last returned by C<next()>. Returns undef if
C<next()> has not been called or if the plan has been reset.

=head3 C<peek>

   my $tag = $plan->peek;

Returns the next tag in the plan, without incrementing the iterator. Returns
C<undef> if there are no more tags beyond the current tag.

=head3 C<all>

  my @tags = $plan->all;

Returns all of the tags in the plan. This constitutes the entire plan.

=head3 C<do>

  $plan->do(sub { say $_[0]->names->[0]; return $_[0]; });
  $plan->do(sub { say $_->names->[0];    return $_;    });

Pass a code reference to this method to execute it for each tag in the plan.
Each item will be set to C<$_> before executing the code reference, and will
also be passed as the sole argument to the code reference. If C<next()> has
been called prior to the call to C<do()>, then only the remaining items in
the iterator will passed to the code reference. Iteration terminates when the
code reference returns false, so be sure to have it return a true value if
you want it to iterate over every item.

=head3 C<write_to>

  $plan->write_to($file);

Write the plan to the named file. Comments and white space from the original
plan are I<not> preserved, so be careful to alert the user when overwriting
an exiting plan file.

=head3 C<open_script>

  my $file_handle = $plan->open_script(
      step => $step,
      tags => \@tag_names,
      dir  => $sqitch->deploy_dir,
  );

Opens the script corresponding to the named step in the specified directory.
The C<tags> option is ignored, but may be used in subclasses to open a script
at a particular point in VCS history. Returns a file handle for reading. The
script file must be encoded in UTF-8.

=head3 C<parse>

Called internally to populate C<all> by parsing the plan file. Not intended
to be used directly, though it may be overridden in subclasses.

=head3 C<load>

  my $tags = $plan->load;

Loads the plan, including untracked steps (if C<with_untracked> is true).
Called internally, not meant to be called directly, as it parses the plan
file and searches the file system (if C<with_untracked>) every time it's
called. If you want the all of the steps, including untracked, call C<all()>
instead.

Subclasses should override this method to load the plan from whatever
resources they deem appropriate.

=head3 C<load_untracked>

  my $tag = $plan->load_untracked($tags);

Loads untracked steps and returns them in a tag object with the single tag
name C<HEAD+>. Pass in an array reference of tracked tags whose steps should
be excluded from the returned untracked. Called internally by C<load()> and
not meant to be called directly, as it will scan the file system on every
call.

Subclasses may override this method to load a tag with untracked steps from
whatever resources they deem appropriate.
