=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Command - Sqitch Command support

=head1 Synopsis

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Command->load( deploy => \%params );
  $cmd->run;

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Command is the base class for all Sqitch commands.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Class Methods

=head3 C<options>

  my @spec = App::Sqitch::Command->options;

Returns a list of L<Getopt::Long> options specifications. When C<load> loads
the class, any options passed to the command will be parsed using these
values. The keys in the resulting hash will be the first part of each option.
This hash will be passed to C<configure> along with a L<App::Sqitch::Config>
object for munging into parameters to be passed to the constructor.

Here's an example excerpted from the C<config> command:

  sub options {
      return qw(
          get
          unset
          list
          global
          system
          config-file=s
      );
  }

This will result in hash keys with the same names as each option except for
C<config-file=s>, which will be named C<config_file>.

=head3 C<configure>

  my $params = App::Sqitch::Command->configure($config, $options);

Takes two arguments, an L<App::Sqitch::Config> object and the hash of
command-line options as specified by C<options>. The returned hash should be
the result of munging these two objects into a hash reference of parameters
to be passed to the command subclass constructor.

By default, this method converts dashes to underscores in command-line
options keys, and then merges the configuration values with the options, with
the command-line options taking priority. You may wish to override this
method to do something different.

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<load>

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Command->load( \%params );

A factory method for instantiating Sqitch commands. It loads the subclass for
the specified command, uses the options returned by C<options> to parse
command-line options, calls C<configure> to merge configuration with the
options, and finally calls C<new> with the resulting hash. Supported
parameters are:

=over

=item C<sqitch>

The App::Sqitch object driving the whole thing.

=item C<config>

An L<App::Sqitch::Config> representing the current application configuration
state.

=item C<command>

The name of the command to be executed.

=item C<args>

An array reference of command-line arguments passed to the command.

=back

=head3 C<new>

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Command->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Command object. This method is not
designed to be overridden by subclasses; they should implement
L<C<BUILDARGS>|Moose::Manual::Construction/BUILDARGS> or
L<C<BUILD>|Moose::Manual::Construction/BUILD>, instead.

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<sqitch>

  my $sqitch = $cmd->sqitch;

Returns the L<App::Sqitch> object that instantiated the command. Commands may
access its properties in order to manage global state.

=head2 Overridable Instance Methods

These methods should be overridden by all subclasses.

=head3 C<execute>

  $cmd->execute;

Executes the command. This is the method that does the work of the command.
Must be overridden in all subclasses. Dies if the method is not overridden
for the object on which it is called, or if it is called against a base
App::Sqitch::Command object.

=head3 C<command>

  my $command = $cmd->command;

The name of the command. Defaults to the last part of the package name, so as
a rule you should not need to override it, since it is that string that
Sqitch uses to find the command class.

=head2 Utility Instance Methods

These methods are mainly provided as utilities for the command subclasses to
use.

=head3 C<run>

  $cmd->run('echo hello');

Runs a system command and waits for it to finish. Throws an exception on
error.

=head3 C<capture>

  my @files = $cmd->capture(qw(ls -lah));

Runs a system command and captures its output to C<STDOUT>. Returns the
output lines in list context and the concatenation of the lines in scalar
context. Throws an exception on error.

=head3 C<probe>

  my $git_version = $cmd->capture(qw(git --version));

Like C<capture>, but returns just the C<chomp>ed first line of output.

=head3 C<verbosity>

  my $verbosity = $cmd->verbosity;

Returns the verbosity level.

=head3 C<trace>

Send trace information to C<STDOUT> if the verbosity level is 3 or higher.
Trace messages will have C<trace: > prefixed to every line. If it's lower
than 3, nothing will be output.

=head3 C<debug>

  $cmd->debug('Found snuggle in the crib.');

Send debug information to C<STDOUT> if the verbosity level is 2 or higher.
Debug messages will have C<debug: > prefixed to every line. If it's lower
than 2, nothing will be output.

=head3 C<info>

  $cmd->info('Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)');

Send informational message to C<STDOUT> if the verbosity level is 1 or
higher, which, by default, it is. Should be used for normal messages the user
would normally want to see. If verbosity is lower than 1, nothing will be
output.

=head3 C<comment>

  $cmd->comment('On database flipr_test');

Send comments to C<STDOUT> if the verbosity level is 1 or higher, which, by
default, it is. Comments have C<# > prefixed to every line. If verbosity is
lower than 1, nothing will be output.

=head3 C<emit>

  $cmd->emit('core.editor=emacs');

Send a message to C<STDOUT>, without regard to the verbosity. Should be used
only if the user explicitly asks for output, such as for C<sqitch config
--get core.editor>.

=head3 C<warn>

  $cmd->warn('Could not find nerble; using nobble instead.');

Send a warning messages to C<STDERR>. Warnings will have C<warning: >
prefixed to every line. Use if something unexpected happened but you can
recover from it.

=head3 C<unfound>

  $cmd->unfound;

Exit the program with status code 1. Best for use for non-fatal errors, such
as when something requested was not found.

=head3 C<fail>

  $cmd->fail('File or directory "foo" not found.');

Send a failure message to C<STDERR> and exit with status code 2. Failures
will have C<fatal: > prefixed to every line. Use if something unexpected
happened and you cannot recover from it.

=head3 C<usage>

  $cmd->usage('Missing "value" argument');

Sends the specified message to C<STDERR>, followed by the usage sections of
the command's documentation. Those sections may be named "Name", "Synopsis",
or "Options". Any or all of these will be shown. The doc used to display them
will be the first found of:

=over

=item C<sqitch-$command-usage>

=item C<sqitch-$command>

=item C<sqitch>

=item C<App::Sqitch::Command::$command>

=item C<App::Sqitch::Command>

=back

For an ideal usage messages, C<sqitch-$command-usage.pod> should be created
by all command subclasses.

=head3 C<help>

  $cmd->help('"foo" is not a valid command.');

Sends messages to C<STDERR> and exists with an additional message to "See
sqitch --help". Help messages will have C<sqitch: > prefixed to every line.
Use if the user has misused the app.

=head3 C<bail>

  $cmd->bail(3, 'The config file is invalid');

Exits with the specified error code, sending any specified messages to
C<STDOUT> if the exit code is 0, and to C<STDERR> if it is not 0.
