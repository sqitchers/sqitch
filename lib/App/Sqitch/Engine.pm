=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Engine - Sqitch Deployment Engine

=head1 Synopsis

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new( sqitch => $sqitch );

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Engine provides the base class for all Sqitch storage engines.
Most likely this will not be of much interest to you unless you are hacking on
the engine code.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Class Methods

=head3 C<key>

  my $name = App::Sqitch::Engine->key;

The key name of the engine. Should be the last part of the package name.

=head3 C<name>

  my $name = App::Sqitch::Engine->name;

The name of the engine. Returns the same value as C<key> by default, but
should probably be overridden to return a display name for the engine.

=head3 C<default_registry>

  my $reg = App::Sqitch::Engine->default_registry;

Returns the name of the default registry for the engine. Most engines just
inherit the default value, C<sqitch>, but some must do more munging, such as
specifying a file name, to determine the default registry name.

=head3 C<default_client>

  my $cli = App::Sqitch::Engine->default_client;

Returns the name of the default client for the engine. Must be implemented by
each engine.

=head3 C<driver>

  my $driver = App::Sqitch::Engine->driver;

The name and version of the database driver to use with the engine, returned
as a string suitable for passing to C<use>. Used internally by C<use_driver()>
to C<use> the driver and, if it dies, to display an appropriate error message.
Must be overridden by subclasses.

=head3 C<use_driver>

  App::Sqitch::Engine->use_driver;

Uses the driver and version returned by C<driver>. Returns an error on failure
and returns true on success.

=head3 C<config_vars>

  my %vars = App::Sqitch::Engine->config_vars;

Returns a hash of names and types to use for configuration variables for the
engine. These can be set under the C<core.$engine_name> section in any
configuration file.

The keys in the returned hash are the names of the variables. The values are
the data types. Valid data types include:

=over

=item C<any>

=item C<int>

=item C<num>

=item C<bool>

=item C<bool-or-int>

=back

Values ending in C<+> (a plus sign) may be specified multiple times. Example:

  (
      client => 'any',
      host   => 'any',
      port   => 'int',
      set    => 'any+',
  )

In this example, the C<port> variable will be stored and retrieved as an
integer. The C<set> variable may be of any type and may be included multiple
times. All the other variables may be of any type.

By default, App::Sqitch::Engine returns:

  (
      target   => 'any',
      registry => 'any',
      client   => 'any',
  )

Subclasses for supported engines will return more.

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<load>

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Engine->load(%params);

A factory method for instantiating Sqitch engines. It loads the subclass for
the specified engine and calls C<new>, passing the Sqitch object. Supported
parameters are:

=over

=item C<sqitch>

The App::Sqitch object driving the whole thing.

=back

=head3 C<new>

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Engine object.

=head2 Instance Accessors

=head3 C<sqitch>

The current Sqitch object.

=head3 C<target>

A string identifying the database target.

Returns the name of the target database. This will usually be the name of
target specified on the command-line, or the default.

=head3 C<uri>

A L<URI::db> object representing the target database. Defaults to a URI
constructed from the L<App::Sqitch> C<db_*> attributes.

=head3 C<destination>

A string identifying the target database. Usually the same as the C<target>,
unless it's a URI with the password included, in which case it returns the
value of C<uri> with the password removed.

=head3 C<registry>

The name of the registry schema or database.

=head3 C<registry_destination>

A string identifying the registry database. In other words, the database in
which Sqitch's own data is stored. It will usually be the same as C<destination()>,
but some engines, such as L<SQLite|App::Sqitch::Engine::sqlite>, may use a
separate database. Used internally to name the target when the registration
tables are created.

=head3 C<start_at>

The point in the plan from which to start deploying changes.

=head3 C<no_prompt>

Boolean indicating whether or not to prompt for reverts. False by default.

=head3 C<log_only>

Boolean indicating whether or not to log changes I<without running deploy or
revert scripts>. This is useful for an existing database schema that needs to
be converted to Sqitch. False by default.

=head3 C<with_verify>

Boolean indicating whether or not to run the verification script after each
deploy script. False by default.

=head3 C<variables>

A hash of engine client variables to be set. May be set and retrieved as a
list.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<registry_destination>

  my $registry_destination = $engine->registry_destination;

Returns the name of the registry database. In other words, the database in
which Sqitch's own data is stored. It will usually be the same as C<target()>,
but some engines, such as L<SQLite|App::Sqitch::Engine::sqlite>, may use a
separate database. Used internally to name the target when the registration
tables are created.

=head3 C<variables>

=head3 C<set_variables>

=head3 C<clear_variables>

  my %vars = $engine->variables;
  $engine->set_variables(foo => 'bar', baz => 'hi there');
  $engine->clear_variables;

Get, set, and clear engine variables. Variables are defined as key/value pairs
to be passed to the engine client in calls to C<deploy> and C<revert>, if the
client supports variables. For example, the
L<PostgreSQL engine|App::Sqitch::Engine::pg> passes all the variables to
the C<psql> client via the C<--set> option, while the
L<Oracle engine|App::Sqitch::Engine::oracle> engine sets them via the
SQL*Plus C<DEFINE> command.

=head3 C<deploy>

  $engine->deploy($to_change);
  $engine->deploy($to_change, $mode);
  $engine->deploy($to_change, $mode);

Deploys changes to the target database, starting with the current deployment
state, and continuing to C<$to_change>. C<$to_change> must be a valid change
specification as passable to the C<index_of()> method of L<App::Sqitch::Plan>.
If C<$to_change> is not specified, all changes will be applied.

The second argument specifies the reversion mode in the case of deployment
failure. The allowed values are:

=over

=item C<all>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes, back to the point at
which deployment started. This is the default.

=item C<tag>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes to the last
successfully-applied tag. If no tags were applied during this deployment, all
changes will be reverted to the pint at which deployment began.

=item C<change>

In the event of failure, no changes will be reverted. This is on the
assumption that a change failure is total, and the change may be applied again.

=back

Note that, in the event of failure, if a reversion fails, the target database
B<may be left in a corrupted state>. Write your revert scripts carefully!

=head3 C<revert>

  $engine->revert;
  $engine->revert($tag);
  $engine->revert($tag);

Reverts the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> from the database, including all of its
associated changes.

=head3 C<verify>

  $engine->verify;
  $engine->verify( $from );
  $engine->verify( $from, $to );
  $engine->verify( undef, $to );

Verifies the database against the plan. Pass in change identifiers, as
described in L<sqitchchanges>, to limit the changes to verify. For each
change, information will be emitted if:

=over

=item *

It does not appear in the plan.

=item *

It has not been deployed to the database.

=item *

It has been deployed out-of-order relative to the plan.

=item *

Its verify script fails.

=back

Changes without verify scripts will emit a warning, but not constitute a
failure. If there are any failures, an exception will be thrown once all
verifications have completed.

=head3 C<check_deploy_dependencies>

  $engine->check_deploy_dependencies;
  $engine->check_deploy_dependencies($to_index);

Validates that all dependencies will be met for all changes to be deployed,
starting with the currently-deployed change up to the specified index, or to
the last change in the plan if no index is passed. If any of the changes to be
deployed would conflict with previously-deployed changes or are missing any
required changes, an exception will be thrown. Used internally by C<deploy()>
to ensure that dependencies will be satisfied before deploying any changes.

=head3 C<check_revert_dependencies>

  $engine->check_revert_dependencies(@changes);

Validates that the list of changes to be reverted, which should be passed in
the order in which they will be reverted, are not depended upon by other
changes. If any are depended upon by other changes, an exception will be
thrown listing the changes that cannot be reverted and what changes depend on
them. Used internally by C<revert()> to ensure no dependencies will be
violated before revering any changes.

=head3 C<deploy_change>

  $engine->deploy_change($change);
  $engine->deploy_change($change);

Used internally by C<deploy()> to deploy an individual change.

=head3 C<revert_change>

  $engine->revert_change($change);
  $engine->revert_change($change);

Used internally by C<revert()> (and, by C<deploy()> when a deploy fails) to
revert an individual change.

=head3 C<verify_change>

  $engine->verify_change($change);

Used internally by C<deploy_change()> to verify a just-deployed change if
C<with_verify> is true.

=head3 C<is_deployed>

  say "Tag deployed"  if $engine->is_deployed($tag);
  say "Change deployed" if $engine->is_deployed($change);

Convenience method that dispatches to C<is_deployed_tag()> or
C<is_deployed_change()> as appropriate to its argument.

=head3 C<earliest_change>

  my $change = $engine->earliest_change;
  my $change = $engine->earliest_change($offset);

Returns the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> object representing the earliest
applied change. With the optional C<$offset> argument, the returned change
will be the offset number of changes following the earliest change.


=head3 C<latest_change>

  my $change = $engine->latest_change;
  my $change = $engine->latest_change($offset);

Returns the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> object representing the latest
applied change. With the optional C<$offset> argument, the returned change
will be the offset number of changes before the latest change.

=head3 C<change_for_key>

  my $change = if $engine->change_for_key(key);

Searches the deployed changes for a change corresponding to the specified key,
which should be in a format as described in L<sqitchchanges>. Throws an
exception if the key matches more than one changes. Returns C<undef> if it
matches no changes.

=head3 C<change_id_for_key>

  my $change_id = if $engine->change_id_for_key(key);

Searches the deployed changes for a change corresponding to the specified key,
which should be in a format as described in L<sqitchchanges>, and returns the
change's ID. Throws an exception if the key matches more than one changes.
Returns C<undef> if it matches no changes.

=head3 C<change_for_key>

  my $change = if $engine->change_for_key(key);

Searches the list of deployed changes for a change corresponding to the
specified key, which should be in a format as described in L<sqitchchanges>.
Throws an exception if the key matches multiple changes.

=head3 C<change_id_for_depend>

  say 'Dependency satisfied' if $engine->change_id_for_depend($depend);

Returns the change ID for a L<dependency|App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend>, if the
dependency resolves to a change currently deployed to the database. Returns
C<undef> if the dependency resolves to no currently-deployed change.

=head3 C<find_change>

  my $change = $engine->find_change(%params);

Finds and returns a deployed change, or C<undef> if the change has not been
deployed. The supported parameters are:

=over

=item C<change_id>

The change ID.

=item C<change>

A change name.

=item C<tag>

A tag name.

=item C<project>

A project name. Defaults to the current project.

=item C<offset>

The number of changes offset from the change found by the other parameters
should actually be returned. May be positive or negative.

=back

The order of precedence for the search is:

=over

=item 1.

Search by change ID, if passed.

=item 2.

Search by change name as of tag, if both are passed.

=item 3.

Search by change name or tag.

=back

The offset, if passed, will be applied relative to whatever change is found by
the above algorithm.

=head3 C<run_deploy>

  $engine->run_deploy($deploy_file);

Runs a deploy script. The implementation is just an alias for C<run_file()>;
subclasses may override as appropriate.

=head3 C<run_revert>

  $engine->run_revert($revert_file);

Runs a revert script. The implementation is just an alias for C<run_file()>;
subclasses may override as appropriate.

=head3 C<run_verify>

  $engine->run_verify($verify_file);

Runs a deploy script. The implementation is just an alias for C<run_file()>;
subclasses may override as appropriate.

=head2 Abstract Instance Methods

These methods must be overridden in subclasses.

=head3 C<begin_work>

  $engine->begin_work($change);

This method is called just before a change is deployed or reverted. It should
create a lock to prevent any other processes from making changes to the
database, to be freed in C<finish_work> or C<rollback_work>.

=head3 C<finish_work>

  $engine->finish_work($change);

This method is called after a change has been deployed or reverted. It should
unlock the lock created by C<begin_work>.

=head3 C<rollback_work>

  $engine->rollback_work($change);

This method is called after a change has been deployed or reverted and the
logging of that change has failed. It should rollback changes started by
C<begin_work>.

=head3 C<initialized>

  $engine->initialize unless $engine->initialized;

Returns true if the database has been initialized for Sqitch, and false if it
has not.

=head3 C<initialize>

  $engine->initialize;

Initializes the target database for Sqitch by installing the Sqitch registry
schema and/or tables. Should be overridden by subclasses. This implementation
throws an exception

=head3 C<register_project>

  $engine->register_project;

Registers the current project plan in the registry database. The
implementation should insert the project name and URI if they have not already
been inserted. If a project with the same name but different URI already
exists, an exception should be thrown.

=head3 C<is_deployed_tag>

  say 'Tag deployed' if $engine->is_deployed_tag($tag);

Should return true if the L<tag|App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> has been applied to
the database, and false if it has not.

=head3 C<is_deployed_change>

  say 'Change deployed' if $engine->is_deployed_change($change);

Should return true if the L<change|App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> has been
deployed to the database, and false if it has not.

=head3 C<are_deployed_changes>

  say "Change $_ is deployed" for $engine->are_deployed_change(@changes);

Should return the IDs of any of the changes passed in that are currently
deployed. Used by C<deploy> to ensure that no changes already deployed are
re-deployed.

=head3 C<change_id_for>

  say $engine->change_id_for(
      change  => $change_name,
      tag     => $tag_name,
      offset  => $offset,
      project => $project,
);

Searches the database for the change with the specified name, tag, and offset.
The parameters are as follows:

=over

=item C<change>

The name of a change. Required unless C<tag> is passed.

=item C<tag>

The name of a tag. Required unless C<change> is passed.

=item C<offset>

The number of changes offset from the change found by the tag and/or change
name. May be positive or negative to mean later or earlier changes,
respectively. Defaults to 0.

=item C<project>

The name of the project to search. Defaults to the current project.

=back

If both C<change> and C<tag> are passed, C<find_change_id> will search for the
last instance of the named change deployed I<before> the tag.

=head3 C<changes_requiring_change>

  my @requiring = $engine->changes_requiring_change($change);

Returns a list of hash references representing currently deployed changes that
require the passed change. When this method returns one or more hash
references, the change should not be reverted. Each hash reference should
contain the following keys:

=over

=item C<change_id>

The requiring change ID.

=item C<change>

The requiring change name.

=item C<project>

The project the requiring change is from.

=item C<asof_tag>

Name of the first tag to be applied after the requiring change was deployed,
if any.

=back

=head3 C<log_deploy_change>

  $engine->log_deploy_change($change);

Should write the records to the registry necessary to indicate that the change
has been deployed.

=head3 C<log_fail_change>

  $engine->log_fail_change($change);

Should write to the database event history a record reflecting that deployment
of the change failed.

=head3 C<log_revert_change>

Should write to and/or remove from the registry the records necessary to
indicate that the change has been reverted.

=head3 C<log_new_tags>

  $engine->log_new_tags($change);

Given a change, if it has any tags that are not currently logged in the
database, they should be logged. This is assuming, of course, that the change
itself has previously been logged.

=head3 C<earliest_change_id>

  my $change_id = $engine->earliest_change_id($offset);

Returns the ID of the earliest applied change from the current project. With
the optional C<$offset> argument, the ID of the change the offset number of

number of changes before the latest change will be returned.

=head3 C<deployed_changes>

  my @change_hashes = $engine->deployed_changes;

Returns a list of hash references, each representing a change from the current
project in the order in which they were deployed. The keys in each hash
reference must be:

=back

=head3 C<deployed_changes_since>

  my @change_hashes = $engine->deployed_changes_since($change);

Returns a list of hash references, each representing a change from the current
project deployed after the specified change. The keys in the hash references
should be the same as for those returned by C<deployed_changes()>.

=head3 C<name_for_change_id>

  my $change_name = $engine->name_for_change_id($change_id);

Returns the name of the change identified by the ID argument. If a tag was
applied to a change after that change, the name will be returned with the tag
qualification, e.g., C<app_user@beta>. This value should be suitable for
uniquely identifying the change, and passing to the C<get> or C<index_of>
methods of L<App::Sqitch::Plan>.

=head3 C<registered_projects>

  my $iter = $engine->current_changes;
  my $iter = $engine->current_changes($project);
  while (my $change = $iter->()) {
      say '* ', $change->{change};

=head3 C<run_file>

  $engine->run_file($file);

Should execute the commands in the specified file. This will generally be an
SQL file to run through the engine's native client.

=head3 C<run_handle>

  $engine->run_handle($file_handle);

Should execute the commands in the specified file handle. The file handle's
contents should be piped to the engine's native client.

=head3 C<load_change>

  my $change = $engine->load_change($change_id);

Given a deployed change ID, loads an returns a hash reference representing the
change in the database. The keys should be the same as those in the hash
references returned by C<deployed_changes()>. Returns C<undef> if the change
has not been deployed.

=head3 C<change_offset_from_id>

  my $change = $engine->change_offset_from_id( $change_id, $offset );

Given a change ID and an offset, returns a hash reference of the data for a
deployed change (with the same keys as defined for C<deployed_changes()>) in
the current project that was deployed C<$offset> steps before the change
identified by C<$change_id>. If C<$offset> is C<0> or C<undef>, the change
represented by C<$change_id> should be returned (just like C<load_change()>).
Otherwise, the change returned should be C<$offset> steps from that change ID,
where C<$offset> may be positive (later step) or negative (earlier step).
Returns C<undef> if the change was not found or if the offset is more than the
number of changes before or after the change, as appropriate.
