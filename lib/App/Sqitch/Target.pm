=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Target - Sqitch deployment target

=head1 Synopsis

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Target->new(
      sqitch => $sqitch,
      name   => 'development',
  );
  $target->engine->deploy;

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Target provides collects, in one place, the
L<engine|App::Sqitch::Engine>, L<plan|App::Sqitch::Engine>, and file locations
required to carry out Sqitch commands. All commands should instantiate a
target to work with the plan or database.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $target = App::Sqitch::Target->new( sqitch => $sqitch );

Instantiates and returns an App::Sqitch::Target object. The most important
parameters are C<sqitch>, C<name>, and C<uri>. The constructor tries really
hard to figure out the proper name and URI during construction. If the C<uri>
parameter is passed, this is straight-forward: if no C<name> is passed,
C<name> will be set to the stringified format of the URI (minus the password,
if present).

Otherwise, when no URI is passed, the name and URI are determined by taking
the following steps:

=over

=item *

If there is no name, get the engine key from or the C<core.engine>
+configuration option. If no key can be determined, an exception will be
thrown.

=item *

Use the key to look up the target name in the C<engine.$engine.target>
configuration option. If none is found, use C<db:$key:>.

=item *

If the name contains a colon (C<:>), assume it is also the value for the URI.

=item *

Otherwise, it should be the name of a configured target, so look for a URI in
the C<target.$name.uri> configuration option.

=back

As a general rule, then, pass either a target name or URI string in the
C<name> parameter, and Sqitch will do its best to find all the relevant target
information. And if there is no name or URI, it will try to construct a
reasonable default from the command-line options or engine configuration.

All Target attributes may be passed as parameters to C<new()>. In addition,
C<new()> accepts a few non-attribute parameters that may be used to override
parts of the connection URI. They are:

=over

=item * C<user>

=item * C<host>

=item * C<port>

=item * C<dbname>

=back

For example, if the the named target had its URI configured as
C<db:pg://fred@example.com/work>, The C<uri> would be set as such by:

  my $target = App::Sqitch::Target->new(sqitch => $sqitch, name => 'work');
  say $target->uri;

However, passing the URI parameters like this:

  my $target = App::Sqitch::Target->new(
      sqitch => $sqitch,
      name => 'work',
      user => 'bill',
      port => 1212,
  );
  say $target->uri;

Sets the URI to C<db:pg://bill@example.com:1212/work>.

=head3 C<all_targets>

Returns a list of all the targets defined by the local Sqitch configuration
file. Done by examining the configuration object to find all defined targets
and engines, as well as the default "core" target. Duplicates are removed and
the list returned. This method takes the same parameters as C<new>; only
C<sqitch> is required. All other parameters will be set on all of the returned
targets.

=head2 Accessors

  my $sqitch = $target->sqitch;

=head3 C<uri>

  my $uri = $target->uri;

=head3 C<username>

  my $username = $target->username;
