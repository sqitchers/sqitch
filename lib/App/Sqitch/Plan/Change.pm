=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Plan::Change - Sqitch deployment plan tag

=head1 Synopsis

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan->new( sqitch => $sqitch );
  for my $line ($plan->lines) {
      say $line->as_string;
  }

=head1 Description

A App::Sqitch::Plan::Change represents a change as parsed from a plan file. In
addition to the interface inherited from L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Line>, it offers
interfaces for parsing dependencies from the deploy script, as well as for
opening the deploy, revert, and verify scripts.

=head1 Interface

See L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Line> for the basics.

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<since_tag>

An L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> object representing the last tag to appear in the
plan B<before> the change. May be C<undef>.

=head3 C<pspace>

Blank space separating the change name from the dependencies, timestamp, and
planner in the file.

=head3 C<is_reworked>

Boolean indicting whether or not the change has been reworked.

=head3 C<info>

Information about the change, returned as a string. Includes the change ID,
the name and email address of the user who added the change to the plan, and
the timestamp for when the change was added to the plan.

=head3 C<id>

A SHA1 hash of the data returned by C<info()>, which can be used as a
globally-unique identifier for the change.

=head3 C<timestamp>

Returns the an L<App::Sqitch::DateTime> object representing the time at which
the change was added to the plan.

=head3 C<planner_name>

Returns the name of the user who added the change to the plan.

=head3 C<planner_email>

Returns the email address of the user who added the change to the plan.

=head3 C<parent>

Parent change object.

=head3 C<tags>

A list of tag objects associated with the change.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<path_segments>

  my @segments = $change->path_segments;

Returns the path segment for the change. For example, if the change is named
"foo", C<('foo.sql')> is returned. If the change is named "functions/bar>
C<('functions', 'bar.sql')> is returned. Internally, this data is used to
create the deploy, revert, and verify file names.

=head3 C<deploy_dir>

  my $file = $change->deploy_dir;

Returns the path to the deploy directory for the change.

=head3 C<deploy_file>

  my $file = $change->deploy_file;

Returns the path to the deploy script file for the change.

=head3 C<revert_dir>

  my $file = $change->revert_dir;

Returns the path to the revert directory for the change.

=head3 C<revert_file>

  my $file = $change->revert_file;

Returns the path to the revert script file for the change.

=head3 C<verify_dir>

  my $file = $change->verify_dir;

Returns the path to the verify directory for the change.

=head3 C<verify_file>

  my $file = $change->verify_file;

Returns the path to the verify script file for the change.

=head3 C<script_file>

  my $file = $sqitch->script_file($script_name);

Returns the path to a script, for the change.

=head3 C<script_hash>

  my $hash = $change->script_hash;

Returns the hex digest of the SHA-1 hash for the deploy script.

=head3 C<rework_tags>

  my @tags = $change->rework_tags;

Returns a list of tags that occur between a change and its next reworking.
Returns an empty list if the change is not reworked.

=head3 C<add_tag>

  $change->add_tag($tag);

Adds a tag object to the change.

=head3 C<add_rework_tags>

  $change->add_rework_tags(@tags);

Adds tags to the list of rework tags.

=head3 C<clear_rework_tags>

  $change->clear_rework_tags(@tags);

Clears the list of rework tags.

=head3 C<requires>

  my @requires = $change->requires;

Returns a list of L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend> objects representing changes
required by this change.

=head3 C<requires_changes>

  my @requires_changes = $change->requires_changes;

Returns a list of the C<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> objects representing
changes required by this change.

=head3 C<conflicts>

  my @conflicts = $change->conflicts;

Returns a list of L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend> objects representing changes
with which this change conflicts.

=head3 C<conflicts_changes>

  my @conflicts_changes = $change->conflicts_changes;

Returns a list of the C<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> objects representing
changes with which this change conflicts.

=head3 C<dependencies>

  my @dependencies = $change->dependencies;

Returns a list of L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend> objects representing all
dependencies, required and conflicting.

=head3 C<is_deploy>

Returns true if the change is intended to be deployed, and false if it should be
reverted.

=head3 C<is_revert>

Returns true if the change is intended to be reverted, and false if it should be
deployed.

=head3 C<action>

Returns "deploy" if the change should be deployed, or "revert" if it should be
reverted.

=head3 C<format_name_with_tags>

  my $name_with_tags = $change->format_name_with_tags;

Returns a string formatted with the change name followed by the list of tags, if
any, associated with the change. Used to display a change as it is deployed.

=head3 C<format_dependencies>

  my $dependencies = $change->format_dependencies;

Returns a string containing a bracketed list of dependencies. If there are no
dependencies, an empty string will be returned.

=head3 C<format_name_with_dependencies>

  my $name_with_dependencies = $change->format_name_with_dependencies;

Returns a string formatted with the change name followed by a bracketed list
of dependencies, if any, associated with the change. Used to display a change
when added to a plan.

=head3 C<format_op_name_dependencies>

  my $op_name_dependencies = $change->format_op_name_dependencies;

Like C<format_name_with_dependencies>, but includes the operator, if present.

=head3 C<format_planner>

  my $planner = $change->format_planner;

Returns a string formatted with the name and email address of the user who
added the change to the plan.

=head3 C<deploy_handle>

  my $fh = $change->deploy_handle;

Returns an L<IO::File> file handle, opened for reading, for the deploy script
for the change.

=head3 C<revert_handle>

  my $fh = $change->revert_handle;

Returns an L<IO::File> file handle, opened for reading, for the revert script
for the change.

=head3 C<verify_handle>

  my $fh = $change->verify_handle;

Returns an L<IO::File> file handle, opened for reading, for the verify script
for the change.

=head3 C<note_prompt>

  my $prompt = $change->note_prompt(
      for     => 'rework',
      scripts => [$change->deploy_file, $change->revert_file],
  );

Overrides the implementation from C<App::Sqitch::Plan::Line> to add the
C<files> parameter. This is a list of the files to be created for the command.
These will usually be the deploy, revert, and verify files, but the caller
might not be creating all of them, so it needs to pass the list.
