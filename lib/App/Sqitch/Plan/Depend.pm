=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend - Sqitch dependency specification

=head1 Synopsis

  my $depend = App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend->new(
        plan => $plan,
        App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend->parse('!proj:change@tag')
  );

=head1 Description

An App::Sqitch::Plan::Line represents a single dependency from the dependency
list for a planned change. Is is constructed by L<App::Sqitch::Plan> and
included in L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> objects C<conflicts> and C<requires>
attributes.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $depend = App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Plan::Line object. Parameters:

=over

=item C<plan>

The plan with which the dependency is associated. Required.

=item C<project>

Name of the project. Required.

=item C<conflicts>

Boolean to indicate whether the dependency is a conflicting dependency.

=item C<change>

The name of the change.

=item C<tag>

The name of the tag claimed as the dependency.

=item C<id>

The ID of a change. Mutually exclusive with C<change> and C<tag>.

=back

=head3 C<parse>

  my %params = App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend->parse($string);

Parses a dependency specification as extracted from a plan and returns a hash
reference of parameters suitable for passing to C<new()>. Returns C<undef> if
the string is not a properly-formatted dependency.

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<plan>

  my $plan = $depend->plan;

Returns the L<App::Sqitch::Plan> object with which the dependency
specification is associated.

=head3 C<conflicts>

  say $depend->as_string, ' conflicts' if $depend->conflicts;

Returns true if the dependency is a conflicting dependency, and false if it
is not (in which case it is a required dependency).

=head3 C<required>

  say $depend->as_string, ' required' if $depend->required;

Returns true if the dependency is a required, and false if it is not (in which
case it is a conflicting dependency).

=head3 C<type>

  say $depend->type;

Returns a string indicating the type of dependency, either "require" or
"conflict".

=head3 C<project>

  my $proj = $depend->project;

Returns the name of the project with which the dependency is associated.

=head3 C<got_project>

Returns true if the C<project> parameter was passed to the constructor with a
defined value, and false if it was not passed to the constructor.

=head3 C<change>

  my $change = $depend->change;

Returns the name of the change, if any. If C<undef> is returned, the dependency
is a tag-only dependency.

=head3 C<tag>

  my $tag = $depend->tag;

Returns the name of the tag, if any. If C<undef> is returned, the dependency
is a change-only dependency.

=head3 C<id>

Returns the ID of the change if the dependency was specified as an ID, or if
the dependency is a local dependency.

=head3 C<got_id>

Returns true if the C<id> parameter was passed to the constructor with a
defined value, and false if it was not passed to the constructor.

=head3 C<resolved_id>

Change ID used by the engine when deploying a change. That is, if the
dependency is in the database, it will be assigned this ID from the database.
If it is not in the database, C<resolved_id> will be undef.

=head3 C<is_external>

Returns true if the dependency references a change external to the current
project, and false if it is part of the current project.

=head3 C<is_internal>

The opposite of C<is_external()>: returns true if the dependency is in the
internal (current) project, and false if not.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<key_name>

Returns the key name of the dependency, with the change name and/or tag,
properly formatted for passing to the C<find()> method of
L<App::Sqitch::Plan>. If the dependency was specified as an ID, rather than a
change or tag, then the ID will be returned.

=head3 C<as_string>

Returns the project-qualified key name. That is, if there is a project name,
it returns a string with the project name, a colon, and the key name. If there
is no project name, the key name is returned.

=head3 C<as_plan_string>

  my $string = $depend->as_string;

Returns the full stringification of the dependency, suitable for output to a
plan file. That is, the same as C<as_string> unless C<conflicts> returns true,
in which case it is prepended with "!".

=over

=item L<App::Sqitch::Plan>
