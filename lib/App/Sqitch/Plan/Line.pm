=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Plan::Line - Sqitch deployment plan line

=head1 Synopsis

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan->new( sqitch => $sqitch );
  for my $line ($plan->lines) {
      say $line->as_string;
  }

=head1 Description

An App::Sqitch::Plan::Line represents a single line from a Sqitch plan file.
Each object managed by an L<App::Sqitch::Plan> object is derived from this
class. This is actually an abstract base class. See
L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change>, L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag>, and
L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Blank> for concrete subclasses.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan::Line->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Plan::Line object. Parameters:

=over

=item C<plan>

The L<App::Sqitch::Plan> object with which the line is associated.

=item C<name>

The name of the line. Should be empty for blank lines. Tags names should
not include the leading C<@>.

=item C<lspace>

The white space from the beginning of the line, if any.

=item C<lopspace>

The white space to the left of the operator, if any.

=item C<operator>

An operator, if any.

=item C<ropspace>

The white space to the right of the operator, if any.

=item C<rspace>

The white space after the name until the end of the line or the start of a
note.

=item C<note>

A note. Does not include the leading C<#>, but does include any white space
immediate after the C<#> when the plan file is parsed.

=back

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<plan>

  my $plan = $line->plan;

Returns the plan object with which the line object is associated.

=head3 C<name>

  my $name = $line->name;

Returns the name of the line. Returns an empty string if there is no name.

=head3 C<lspace>

  my $lspace = $line->lspace.

Returns the white space from the beginning of the line, if any.

=head3 C<rspace>

  my $rspace = $line->rspace.

Returns the white space after the name until the end of the line or the start
of a note.

=head3 C<note>

  my $note = $line->note.

Returns the note. Does not include the leading C<#>, but does include any
white space immediate after the C<#> when the plan file is parsed. Returns the
empty string if there is no note.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<format_name>

  my $formatted_name = $line->format_name;

Returns the name of the line properly formatted for output. For
L<tags|App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag>, it's the name with a leading C<@>. For all
other lines, it is simply the name.

=head3 C<format_operator>

  my $formatted_operator = $line->format_operator;

Returns the formatted representation of the operator. This is just the
operator an its associated white space. If neither the operator nor its white
space exists, an empty string is returned. Used internally by C<as_string()>.

=head3 C<format_content>

  my $formatted_content $line->format_content;

Formats and returns the main content of the line. This consists of an operator
and its associated white space, if any, followed by the formatted name.

=head3 C<format_note>

  my $note = $line->format_note;

Returns the note formatted for output. That is, with a leading C<#> and
newlines encoded.

=head3 C<as_string>

  my $string = $line->as_string;

Returns the full stringification of the line, suitable for output to a plan
file.

=head3 C<request_note>

  my $note = $line->request_note( for => 'add' );

Request the note from the user. Pass in the name of the command for which the
note is requested via the C<for> parameter. If there is a note, it is simply
returned. Otherwise, an editor will be launched and the user asked to write
one. Once the editor exits, the note will be retrieved from the file, saved,
and returned. If no note was written, an exception will be thrown with an
C<exitval> of 1.

=head3 C<note_prompt>

  my $prompt = $line->note_prompt( for => 'tag' );

Returns a localized string for use in the temporary file created by
C<request_note()>. Pass in the name of the command for which to prompt via the
C<for> parameter.

=item L<App::Sqitch::Plan>
