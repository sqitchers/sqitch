=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Plan::LineList - Sqitch deployment plan line list

=head1 Synopsis

  my $list = App::Sqitch::Plan::LineList->new(@lines);

  my @lines = $list->items;
  my $index = $list->index_of($line);

  $lines->append($another_line);

=head1 Description

This module is used internally by L<App::Sqitch::Plan> to manage plan file
lines. It's modeled on L<Array::AsHash>, but is much simpler and hews closer
to the API of L<App::Sqitch::Plan::ChangeList>.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $plan = App::Sqitch::Plan::LineList->new(map { $_->name => @_ } @changes );

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Plan::LineList object. The parameters
should be a key/value list of lines. Keys may be duplicated, as long as a tag
appears between each instance of a key.
