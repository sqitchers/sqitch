=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Engine::sqlite - Sqitch SQLite Engine

=head1 Synopsis

  my $sqlite = App::Sqitch::Engine->load( engine => 'sqlite' );

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Engine::sqlite provides the SQLite storage engine for Sqitch.

=head1 Interface

=head3 Class Methods

=head3 C<config_vars>

  my %vars = App::Sqitch::Engine::sqlite->config_vars;

Returns a hash of names and types to use for variables in the C<core.sqlite>
section of the a Sqitch configuration file. The variables and their types are:

  client        => 'any'
  db_name       => 'any'
  sqitch_prefix => 'any'

=head2 Accessors

=head3 C<client>

Returns the path to the SQLite client. If C<--db-client> was passed to
L<sqitch>, that's what will be returned. Otherwise, it uses the
C<core.sqlite.client> configuration value, or else defaults to C<sqlite3> (or
C<sqlite3.exe> on Windows), which should work if it's in your path.

=head3 C<db_name>

Returns the name of the database file. If C<--db-name> was passed to L<sqitch>
that's what will be returned.

=head3 C<sqitch_prefix>

Returns the prefix to use for the Sqitch metadata tables. Returns the value of
the L<core.sqlite.sqitch_prefix> configuration value, or else defaults to
"sqitch".
