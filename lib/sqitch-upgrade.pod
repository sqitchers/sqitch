=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] upgrade [<options>] [<database>]

=head1 Description

Upgrades the Sqitch registry for a database. That is, it makes sure that the
schema the Sqitch uses for its registry is up-to-date. This will occasionally
be necessary when new features are added to Sqitch that require registry
schema changes.

The C<< <database> >> parameter specifies the database to which to connect,
and may also be specified as the C<--target> option. It can be target name,
a URI, an engine name, or plan file path.

=head1 Options

=item C<--target>

The target database to which to connect. This option can be either a URI or
the name of a target in the configuration.
