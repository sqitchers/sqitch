sqitch-check - Runs checks

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch check [options] [<database>]

=head1 Description

Runs various checks on the state of the working directory and the database.
The SHA1 hashes of the deployed scripts are compared the the ones from the
working directory. Where discrepancies are found, messages are printed,
indicating to the user that the working directory deploy scripts are different
from the scripts that were used to deploy to the database.

The C<< <database> >> parameter specifies the database to which to connect,
and may also be specified as the C<--target> option. It can be target name,
a URI, an engine name, or plan file path.
