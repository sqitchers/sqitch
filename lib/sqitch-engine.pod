=head1 Description

Manage the database engines you deploy to. The list of supported engines
includes:

=over

=item * C<firebird>

=item * C<mysql>

=item * C<oracle>

=item * C<pg>

=item * C<sqlite>

=item * C<vertica>

=back

Each engine may have a number of properties:

=over

=item C<target>

The name or URI of the database target. The default is C<db:$engine>.
See L<sqitch-target> for details on target configuration.

=item C<registry>

The name of the registry schema or database. The default is C<sqitch>.

=item C<client>

The command-line client to use. If not specified, each engine looks in the OS
Path for an appropriate client.

=item C<top_dir>

The path to the top directory for the engine. This directory generally
contains the plan file and subdirectories for deploy, revert, and verify
scripts. The default is F<.>, the current directory.

=item C<plan_file>

The plan file to use for this engine. The default is C<$top_dir/sqitch.plan>.

=item C<deploy_dir>

The path to the deploy directory for the engine. This directory contains all
of the deploy scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/deploy>.

=item C<revert_dir>

The path to the revert directory for the engine. This directory contains all
of the revert scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/revert>.

=item C<verify_dir>

The path to the verify directory for the engine. This directory contains all
of the verify scripts referenced by changes in the C<plan_file>. The default
is C<$top_dir/verify>.

=item C<extension>

The file name extension to append to change names to create script file names.
The default is C<sql>.

=back

Each of these overrides the corresponding core configuration -- for example,
the C<core.target>, C<core.plan_file>, C<core.registry>, and C<core.client>
L<config|sqitch-config> options.
