=head1 Name

sqitch-init - Create a new Sqitch project

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] init project
  sqitch [options] init --uri uri project

=head1 Description

This command creates an new Sqitch project -- basically a F<sqitch.conf> file,
a F<sqitch.plan> file, and a F<sql> directory with F<deploy>, F<revert>, and
F<verify> subdirectories.

Running sqitch init in an existing project is safe. It will not overwrite
things that are already there.

=head1 Options

=over

=item C<--uri>

Optional URI to associate with the project. If present, the URI will be
written to the project plan and used for added uniqueness in hashed object
IDs.

=back

=head1 Configuration

The most important thing C<sqitch init> does is create the project plan file,
F<sqitch.conf>. While the C<init> command has no options of its own, it relies
on several of the options to C<sqitch> to determine what to write to this file:

=over

=item C<--plan-file>

Sets the C<core.plan_file> configuration variable.

=item C<--top-dir>

Determines the top-level directory to use when writing the plan and
theC<core.deploy_dir>, C<core.revert_dir>, and C<core.verify_dir> variables --
unless they are overridden by their more-specific options, detailed below.

=item C<--deploy-dir>

Sets the C<core.deploy_dir> configuration variable.

=item C<--revert-dir>

Sets the C<core.revert_dir> configuration variable.

=item C<--verify-dir>

Sets the C<core.verify_dir> configuration variable.

=item C<--extension>

Sets the C<core.extension> configuration variable.

=item C<--engine>

Sets the C<core.engine> configuration variable.

=item C<--client>

Sets the C<engine.$engine.client> configuration variable if C<--engine> is also
passed.

=item C<--registry>

Sets the C<engine.$engine.registry> configuration variable if C<--engine> is also
passed.

=back

As a general rule, you likely won't need any of them except for C<--engine>,
since many commands need to know what engine to use, and specifying it on the
command-line forever after would be annoying.

These variables will only be written if their corresponding options are
specified. Otherwise, they get written as comments with user or system
configuration settings, or, failing any values from those locations, from
their default values. If no defaults are specified, they will still be
written, commented out, with a bar C<=> and no value. This allows one to know
what sorts of things are available to edit.

=head1 Examples

Start a new Sqitch project using the SQLite engine, setting the top directory
for the project to F<sqlite>:

  sqitch --engine sqlite --top-dir sqlite init

Start a new Sqitch project using the PostgreSQL engine, setting the top
directory to F<postgres>, a script extension of C<ddl>, and a version-specific
client:

  sqitch --engine    pg \
         --top-dir   postgres \
         --extension ddl \
         --client    /opt/pgsql-9.1/bin/psql init
