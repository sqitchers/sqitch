-- This script upgrades the Sqitch registry for MySQL 5.5.0 and higher. It
-- creates the checkit() function and sets up triggers in the registry to use
-- it to emulate CHECK constraints. It will then also be available for use in
-- verify scripts, as described in sqitchtutorial-mysql. If you have an
-- existing Sqitch registry that was upgraded from an earlier version of MySQL
-- to 5.5.0 or highher, you'll need to run this script to update it, like so:

--      mysql -u root sqitch --execute "source `sqitch --etc`/tools/upgrade-registry-to-mysql-5.5.0.sql'
