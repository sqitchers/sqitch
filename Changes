Revision history for Perl extension App::Sqitch

0.9994
     - Reduced minimum required MySQL engine from 5.1.0 to 5.0.0. Thanks to
       @dgc-wh for testing it (Issue #251).
     - Fixed floating-point rounding issue with SQLite registry versions on
       Perls with 16-byte doubles. Thanks to H. Merijn Brand for the report
       and testing.
     - Fixed an error when adding an engine with the `engine` command. Thanks
       to Victor Mours for the report and fix!
     - Updated the Google engine to support Oracle Wallet connection strings,
       where no username or host is in the connection URI. Thanks to Timothy
       Procter for the patch!

0.9993  2015-08-17T17:55:26Z
     [Bug Fixes]
     - Eliminated test failures due to warnings from DateTime::Locale when
       `LC_TIME` is set to C.UTF-8. Thanks to Shantanu Bhadoria for the report
       and Dave Rolsky for the workaround.
     - Fixed an error checking the registry version when the local uses a
       comma for decimal values. Thanks to Steffen Müller for the report
       (Issue #234).
     - Worked around an error setting the MySQL storage engine using versions
       of DBI prior to 1.631. Thanks to melon-babak for the report!
     - Fixed an error from the Oracle engine when deploying more than 1000
       changes. Thanks to Timothy Procter and Minh Hoang for the report and
       testing the fix.
     - Fixed a bunch of typos in error messages, comments, and documentation.
       Thanks to Dmitriy for the pull request!
     - Fixed test failures due to new warnings from File::Path on Perl
       5.23.1.
     - On Firebird, Looking up a change and tag in the database (via the
       `--onto` option to `rebase` or the `--to` option to `revert`, among
       others) would sometimes return the incorrect change if the change has
       been reworked two or more times. Was fixed for the other engines in
       v0.9991.
     - Fixed the `--all` option used to apply a command to all known targets
       so that it loads only targets specified by the local configuration.
       Otherwise, user and system configuration can get in the way when they
       specify engines and targets not used by the current project.
     [Improvements]
     - Added support for the `--set` option when deploying to MySQL. Thanks to
       Chris Bandy for figuring out how to do it!
     - Added support for a "reworked directory". By default, reworked change
       scripts live in the deploy, revert, and verify directories along with
       all the other change scripts. But if that starts to get too messy, or
       you simply don't want to see them, add a `reworked_dir` setting to the
       core, engine, or target config and reworked scripts will be stored
       there, instead. Also supported are `reworked_deploy_dir`,
       `reworked_revert_dir`, and `reworked_verify_dir`.
     - Added the `--dir` option to the `init`, `engine`, and `target`
       commands.
     - Copied the core configuration options (`--engine`, `--target`,
       `--plan-file`, `--registry`, etc.) to the `init`, `engine`, and
       `target` commands. This means that they can be specified after the
       command, which is a bit more natural. It also means that the
       `--registry` and `--client` options of the `target` are no longer
       deprecated.
     - The `init` command on longer writes out commented values for the
       `deploy_dir`, `revert_dir`, or `verify_dir` settings. I think these
       settings are not commonly used, and it would start to get crowded if we
       also added their "reworked" variants, which will be used still less.
     - Added the `alter` action to the `engine` and `target` commands to set
       engine and target properties.
     - Added support for setting reworked directories to the `engine` and
       `target` commands.
     - Reformatted the output of the `engine` and `target` command `show`
       actions to include reworked directories, and to bit a bit less flat.
     - Attempting to add or alter an engine with a target URI that connects to
       a different engine now triggers an error. For example, you can't set
       the target for engine `pg` to `db:sqlite:`.
     - The `add` and `alter` actions of the `engine` and `target` commands
       now create script directories if they don't already exist.
     - The `add` action of the `engine` and `target` commands now creates a
       plan file if one does not exist in the specified location for the
       engine or target.
     - Added the `deploy_dir`, `revert_dir`, and `verify_dir` methods to
       App::Sqitch::Plan::Change. Each points to the proper directory for the
       target depending on whether or not the change has been reworked.
     - In the MySQL engine, the following URI query params will be converted
       to options passed to the command-line client, if they're present:
       * mysql_compression=1   => --compress
       * mysql_ssl=1           => --ssl
       * mysql_connect_timeout => --connect_timeout
       * mysql_init_command    => --init-command
       * mysql_socket          => --socket
       * mysql_ssl_client_key  => --ssl-key
       * mysql_ssl_client_cert => --ssl-cert
       * mysql_ssl_ca_file     => --ssl-ca
       * mysql_ssl_ca_path     => --ssl-capath
       * mysql_ssl_cipher      => --ssl-cipher
     [Documentation]
     - Added the "Overworked" section to sqitch-configuration guide with an
       example of how to move reworked change scripts into a `reworked_dir`.
     [Deprecations]
     - Deprecated the `set-*` actions in the `engine` and `target` commands in
       favor of the new `alter` action.
     - The core `--deployed-dir`, `--revert-dir`, and `--verify-dir` options
       are deprecated in favor of the `--dir` option on the `init`, `engine`,
       and `target` command.

0.9992 2015-05-20T23:51:41Z
     - On PostgreSQL, Sqitch now sets the `client_encoding` parameter to
       `UTF8` for its own connection to the database. This ensures that data
       sent to and from the databse should always be properly encoded and
       decoded. Users should still set the proper encodings for change scripts
       as appropriate.
     - Fixed test failures due to path differences on Windows.
     - DateTime::TimeZone is now explicitly required in an attempt to head off
       "Cannot determine local time zone" errors.
     - Corrected some typos and thinkos in `sqitchtutorial-oracle`, thanks to
       George Hartzell.
     - Improved the script to upgrade an Oracle registry to v1.0 to support
       versions prior to Oracle 12, thanks to Timothy Procter.
     - Added missing closing parenthesis to the "Nothing to deploy" message.
       Thanks to George Hartzell for the pull request (Issue #226).
     - Replaced the unique constraint on the `script_hash` column in the
       `changes` registry table with a unique constraint on `project` and
       `script_hash`. This is to allow a deploy script to be used in more than
       one project in a single database. This change increments the registry
       version to v1.1. Thanks to Timothy Procter for the report.
     - Updated the registry check constraints to have consistent names on the
       engines that support them. This will make it easier to modify the
       constraints in the future.
     - Fixed precision issues with the registry version on MySQL and Firebird.
     - Added comment to sqitch-passwords guide that MySQL::Config is required
       to read passwords from the MySQL configuration files. Thanks to
       Sterling Hanenkamp for the patch!

0.9991 2015-04-03T23:14:39Z
     [Improvements]
     - Reduced minimum required MySQL engine from 5.6.4 to 5.1.0. Versions
       prior to 5.6.4 lose the following features:
       * Versions earlier than 5.6.4 is fractional second precision on
         registry `DATETIME` columns. Since the ordering of those timestamps
         is so important to the functioning of Sqitch, it will sleep in 100 ms
         increments between logging changes to the registry until the time has
         ticked over to the next second. Naturally, reverts and deploys will
         be a little slower on versions of MySQL before 5.6.4, but accurate.
       * Versions earlier than 5.5.0 lose the `checkit()` functions, which
         would otherwise be used to emulate CHECK constraints in the registry,
         as well as in user-created verify scripts, as recommended in the
         MySQL tutorial, `sqitchtutorial-mysql`.
     - Added a script to update the `DATETIME` columns in a MySQL Sqitch
       registry that was upgraded to MySQL 5.6.4 or higher. It will be
       installed as `tools/upgrade-registry-to-mysql-5.6.4.sql` in the
       directory returned by `sqitch --etc`.
     - Added a script to add the `checkit()` function and registry triggers to
       emulate CHECK constraints to a MySQL Sqitch registry that was upgraded
       to MySQL 5.5.0 or higher. It will be installed as
       `tools/upgrade-registry-to-mysql-5.5.0.sql` in the directory returned
       by `sqitch --etc`.
     - The `init` command now throws an error when the plan file already
       exists and is invalid or defined for a different project. Thanks to
       Gabriel Potkány for the suggestion (Issue #214).
     - All commands that take target arguments can now specify them as engine
       names or plan file paths as well as target names and URIs.
     - Added the `--all` option and the `$command.all` configuration variable
       to the `add`, `rework`, `tag`, and `bundle` commands. This option tells
       the commands to do their thing for all plans known from the
       configuration, not just the default plan.
     - Pass engine, target, or plan file names to the `add`, `rework`, `tag`,
       and `bundle` commands` commands to specify specify one or more targets,
       engines, and plans to act on.
     - Added the `--change` option to the `add`, `rework`, and `tag` commands
       to distinguish the change to be added, reworked, or tagged from
       plan-specifying arguments, if necessary.
     - Added the `--tag` option to the `tag` command to distinguish the tag to
       be added from plan-specifying arguments, if necessary.
     - Changed the short variant of the `--conflicts` option to the `add` and
       `rework` commands from `-c` to `-x`. The `-c` option is now used as the
       short variant for `--change` (and `--conflicts` has almost certainly
       never been used, anyway).
     - Added the `engine` and `project` variables to the execution of script
       templates by the `add` command. The default templates now use it to
       make their first lines one of:
       * -- Deploy [% project %]:[% change %] to [% engine]
       * -- Revert [% project %]:[% change %] from [% engine]
       * -- Verify [% project %]:[% change %] on [% engine]
     [Bug Fixes]
     - DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 is now required on Windows.
     - The MySQL engine no longer passes `--skip-pager` on Windows, since
       it is not supported there. Thanks to Gabriel Potkány for the report
       (Issue #213).
     - Fixed "no such table: changes" error when upgrading the SQLite
       registry.
     - Fixed upgrade failure on PostgreSQL 8.4. Thanks to Phillip Smith for
       the report!
     - Fixed an error when the `status` command `show_changes` and `show_tags`
       configuration variables were set. Thanks to Adrian Klaver for the
       report (Issue #219).
     - Fixed `log` and `plan` usage statements to properly spell `--abbrev`.
       Thanks to Adrian Klaver for the report (Issue #220).
     - Fixed the formatting of change notes so that a space precedes the `#`
       character whether the note was added by the `--note` option or via an
       editor.
     - Fixed a bug when parsing plan files with DOS/Windows line endings.
       Thanks to Timothy Procter for the report (Issue #212).
     - Looking up a change and tag in the database (via the `--onto` option to
       `rebase` or the `--to` option to `revert`, among others) would
       sometimes return the incorrect change if the change has been reworked
       two or more times. Thanks to BryLo for the report!
     [Documentation]
     - Updated docs to be consistent in referring to the location of the system
       configuration and template location as `$(prefix)/etc/sqitch`. Also
       added notes pointing to the `--etc-dir` to find out exactly what that
       resolves to. Suggested by Joseph Anthony Pasquale Holsten (Issue #167).
     [Deprecations]
     - Reverted deprecation of the database connection options. Target URIs
       are still generally preferred, but sometimes you want to use a target
       but just change the user name or database name. Retaining the options
       is the easiest way to do this. Plus, a fair number of people have
       scripts that use these options, and it seems petty to break them. Sorry
       for the double-take here! The list of un-deprecated options is:
       * `--db-client`
       * `--db-host`
       * `--db-port`
       * `--db-username`
       * `--db-password`
       * `--db-name`

0.999  2015-02-12T19:43:45Z
     - Improved MySQL missing table error detection by relying on error codes
       instead of matching a (possibly localized) error string.
     - Made the registry upgrade more transparent when deploying. Sqitch is
       now is a little more vigilent in checking for things being out-of-date
       and updating them.
     - Fixed an issue where the `status` command would return an error when
       run against a an older version of the registry.
     - Fixed a Postgres test failure when DBD::Pg is installed but psql is not
       in the path.
     - Now require Config::GitLike 1.15 to build on Windows in order to avoid
       test failures when Cwd::abs_path dies on non-existant paths.
     - Clarified the behavior of each `deploy` reversion mode with regard to
       deploy script vs. verify script failures, and with the expectation that
       deploy scripts are atomic.
     - Target passwords can now be set via a single environment variable,
       `$SQITCH_PASSWORD`. Its value will override URI-specified password.
     - Added the sqitch-passwords and sqitch-environment guides.

0.998  2015-01-15T22:17:44Z
     - Fixed a bug in `sqitch engine update-config` where it would add data to
       config files that did not previously have them, or report that data was
       present in nonexistent config files.
     - Added the `releases` table to the databases. This table will keep track
       of releases of the Sqitch registry schema.
     - The Oracle `registry` variable is now always `DEFINE`d when Oracle
       scripts run.
     - Added the `upgrade` command, which upgrades the schema for the Sqitch
       registry for a target database.
     - Added the `script_hash` column to the `changes` registry table. This
       column contains a SHA-1 hash of the deploy script for the change at the
       time it was deployed. For existing registries, the upgrade script sets
       its value to be the same as the change ID. This value is update the
       next time a project is deployed to the database.
     - The error message when `deploy` cannot find the currently-deployed
       change ID in the plan now includes more contextual information,
       including the change name, associated tags, and the plan file name.
       Suggested by Curtis Poe (Issue #205).
     - Comments on Firebird registry objects are now created with the
       `COMMENT` command, rather than INSERTs into catalog tables.
     - Added support for "merge" events, though none are logged, yet.

0.997 2014-11-04T22:52:23Z
     [New Features]
     - Added support for new target properties. In addition to the existing
       `uri`, `client`, and `registry` properties, targets may also configure
       these properties via the new `--set` option to and `set-*` actions on
       the `target` command:
       * `top_dir`
       * `plan_file`
       * `extension`
       * `deploy_dir`
       * `revert_dir`
       * `verify_dir`
     - Added support for new engine configuration variables. In addition to
       the existing `target`, `client`, and `registry` variables, engine
       configuration may also include these variables:
       * `top_dir`
       * `plan_file`
       * `extension`
       * `deploy_dir`
       * `revert_dir`
       * `verify_dir`
     - Rationalized the hierarchical configuration of deployment targets. The
       properties of any given target will now be determined by examining
       values in the following order:
       * Command-line options
       * Target configuration
       * Engine configuration
       * Core configuration
       * Reasonable engine-specific defaults
     - Added the `engine` command to simplify engine configuration. This
       complements the newly-improved `target` command. Run `sqitch engine
       update-config` to update deprecated engine configurations and start
       using it.
     - Added the sqitch-configuration guide to provide an overview of core,
       engine, and target configuration. Includes some use-case examples and
       best suggested practices.
     [Improvements]
     - Simplified the output of `sqitch help`, and added the more important
       options to it.
     - Added the `--guide` option to `sqitch help` to list Sqitch guides.
     - Renamed the `--db-client` option to `--client`. `--db-client` still
       works, but is deprecated.
     - Added the `--registry` core option for parity with `--client`,
       `--top-dir`, `--plan-file`, and the rest of the hierarchical
       configuration properties.
     - Updated the `init` documentation to better cover all the options
       processed.
     - Incremented the version plan file format version to v1.0.0. No changes;
       it has been stable for at least a year, so it's time.
     [Bug Fixes]
     - At runtime, the Vertica engine now properly requires DBD::ODBC
       instead of DBD::Pg.
     - The Vertica engine now supports Vertica 6, as documented.
     - Fixed a warning from Type::Utils, thanks to a report from Géraud
       CONTINSOUZAS.
     - The `status` command once again notices if the specified database is
       uninitialized and says as much, rather than dying with an SQL error.
     - The `--etc-path` option works again.
     [Deprecations]
     - Deprecated `core.$engine` configuration in favor of `engine.$engine`. A
       warning will be emitted if Sqitch sees the former. Run `sqitch engine
       update-config` to update your configurations. Existing `core.$engine`
       configurations will be left in place for compatibility with older
       versions of Sqitch, but the `sqitch engine` command will not modify
       them, so they can get out-of-sync. Run `sqitch config --remove-section
       core.$engine` to remove them.
     - Formally deprecated the database connection options in favor of target
       URIs. If any of these options is used, a warning will be issued. They
       will be dropped in v1.0:
       * `--db-host`
       * `--db-port`
       * `--db-username`
       * `--db-password`
       * `--db-name`
     - Formally deprecated the database connection configuration variables in
       favor of target URIs. If any of these variables is used, a warning will
       be issued. Run `sqitch engine update-config` to update your
       configurations. Existing `core.$engine` configurations will be left in
       place for compatibility with older versions of Sqitch, but the `sqitch
       engine` command will not modify them, so they can get out-of-sync. Run
       `sqitch config --remove-section core.$engine` to remove them. Sqitch
       will cease to support them in v1.0:
       * `core.$engine.host`
       * `core.$engine.port`
       * `core.$engine.username`
       * `core.$engine.password`
       * `core.$engine.db_name`
     - Deprecated the `--registry` and `--client` options of the `target`
       command. All target properties should now be set via the new `--set`
       option, such as `--set registry=reg`.
     - Formally deprecated the following options of the `add` command. They
       have been replaced with the `--with`, `--without`, and `--use` options
       since v0.991. Their use will emit a warning, and they will be removed
       in v1.0:
       * `--deploy-template`
       * `--revert-template`
       * `--verify-template`
       * `--deploy`
       * `--no-deploy`
       * `--revert`
       * `--no-revert`
       * `--verify`
       * `--no-verify`
     - Dropped support for the long-deprecated (and likely never used outside
       ancient tests long deleted) engine configuration variables
       `core.sqlite.sqitch_db` and `core.pg.sqitch_schema`. Both have been
       replaced with `engine.$engine.registry`, which applies to all engines.
     - Formally deprecated the `@FIRST` and `@LAST` symbolic tags. Their use
       will trigger a warning to use `@ROOT` and `@HEAD`, instead. They will
       be removed in v1.0.
     [Internals]
     - Moved target and engine configuration from App::Sqitch and
       App::Sqitch::Engine to a new class, App::Sqitch::Target. This class is
       solely responsible for finding the appropriate values for attributes on
       every run. The target knows what plan and engine to use, based on those
       properties. App::Sqitch is now responsible solely for encapsulating
       command-line options, configuration, and utilities. Classes are now
       responsible for instantiating both an App::Sqitch and
       App::Sqitch::Target options as appropriate.
     - Updated all classes to create both Sqitch and Target objects as
       appropriate. This change touched almost every class.
     - Replaced attributes in App::Sqitch that were previously set from
       command-line options or configuration with a single attribute,
       `options`, which is a hash only of the command-line options. Classes
       are now responsible for finding the proper values in config or options.
       Mostly this requirement is encapsulated by the new App::Sqitch::Target
       class.
     - Updated the command classes to use either a "default target" derived
       from command-line options, engine configuration, and core
       configuration, or a target looked up by name in the configuration
       maintained by the `target` command.

0.996  2014-09-05T21:11:00Z
     - Fixed one more test failure due to the introduction of "Negative repeat
       count does nothing" warning in Perl 5.21.1.
     - Fixed "Redundant argument in printf" warning on Perl 5.21.2.
     - Switched from Digest::SHA1, which is deprecated, to Digest::SHA for
       generating SHA-1 IDs.
     - Switched from Mouse and Moose to Moo. Sqitch no longer depends on any
       modules that use Moose, either. This results in an approximately 40%
       startup time speedup.
     - Loading of App::Sqitch::DateTime is now deferred until it's needed.
       This is because DateTime is rather expensive to load. Since a number of
       commands don't need it, it seems silly to load it in those cases.
     - Now recommend Type::Tiny::XS and Class::XSAccessor for improved
       performance.
     - The `check` command now properly fails on a plan parse error, instead
       of blindly continuing on.
     - Fixed a failing test on PostgreSQL due to localization issues. Thanks
       to Sven Schoberf for the report (Issue #171).
     - Added the `revert.prompt_accept`, `rebase.prompt_accept`, and
       `checkout.prompt_accept` boolean configuration variables. Set these
       variables to false to change the default answer to the revert prompt to
       "No". When rebasing or checking out, if the variables specific to those
       commands are not set, Sqitch will fall back on the value of
       `revert.prompt_accept`. Suggested by Graeme Lawton (Issue #164).
     - The MySQL engine now sets the `$MYSQL_PWD` environment variable if a
       password is provided in a target. This should simplify authentication
       when running MySQL change scripts through the `mysql` client client
       (Issue #150).
     - The MySQL engine now reads `client` and `mysql` groups in the MySQL
       configuration files for a password when connecting to the registry
       database, and when the target URI includes no password. The MySQL
       client already read those files, of course, but now the internal
       database connection does as well (Issue #150).
     - The Firebird engine now sets the `$ISC_PASSWORD` environment variable
       if a password is provided in a target. This should simplify
       authentication when running Firebird change scripts through the `isql`
       client client. Patch from Ștefan Suciu.
     - No longer passing URI query params as DBI params, because they are
       already included in the DSN provided by URI::db.
     - Added the Vertica engine.

0.995  2014-07-13T22:24:53Z
     - Fixed test failures due to the introduction of "Negative repeat count
       does nothing" warning in Perl 5.21.1.
     - Fixed more test failures when DBD::Firebird is installed but Firebird
       isql cannot be found.
     - Fixed registry file naming issues on Win32 for the SQLite engine, and
       as well as the tests that failed because of it.
     - Worked around Config::GitLike bug on Windows in the target test.
     - Changed the exit value for an attempt to deploy to an up-to-date
       database from 1 to 0. In other words, it no longer looks like an error
       (Issue #147).

0.994  2014-06-20T02:58:10Z
     - Fixed installation failure due to missing IO::File module on Windows.
     - Fixed file test failure for the Oracle engine on Windows.
     - Fixed bug where namespace-autoclean: 0.16 caused errors such as
       "Invalid object instance: 'yellow'".
     - Fixed Oracle SQL*Plus capture test failure on Windows.

0.993  2014-06-04T20:14:34Z
     - Fixed engine loading to prefer the engine implied by the target URI
       over the `core.engine` configuration variable. This means that you no
       longer have to pass `--engine` when using commands that accept a target
       option or argument, such as `deploy`.
     - Fixed test failure when DBD::Firebird is installed but Firebird isql
       cannot be found.
     - Fixed issue where the revert command fails to execute the proper revert
       script. This can occur when a change has been reworked in the plan, but
       the reworked version of the change has not been deployed to the
       database. Thanks to Timothy Procter for the report (Issue #166).
     - Fixed issue with aggregating text values with `COLLECT()` on Oracle.
       Thanks to Timothy Procter for the digging and invocation of an Oracle
       support request (Issue #91).
     - Fixed issue where SQL*Plus could not run rework scripts because of the
       `@` in the file name. It now uses a symlink (or copied file on Windows)
       to circumvent the problem. Thanks to Timothy Procter for the report
       (Issue #165).
     - Fix issue where, on first deploy, the MySQL engine would fail to notice
       that the server was not the right version of MySQL. Thanks to Luke
       Young for the report (Issue #158).
     - Made the `checkit()` MySQL function DETERMINISTIC, to improve
       compatability with MariaDB. Thanks to Jesse Luehrs for the report
       (Issue #158).
     - Fixed deployment to PostgreSQL 8.4 so that it no longer chokes on the
       `:tableopts`. Thanks to Justin Hawkins for the report!

0.992  2014-03-05T00:34:49Z
     - Fixed target test failures on Windows.
     - Added support for Postgres-XC to the PostgreSQL engine. Sqitch registry
       tables are distributed by replication to all data nodes.
     - Added support to MariaDB 5.3 and higher to the MySQL engine, thanks to
       Ed Silva.

0.991  2014-01-16T23:24:33Z
     - Greatly simplified determining the Firebird ISQL client. It no longer
       tries so hard to find a full path, but does seach through the path list
       for a likely candidate between fbsql, isql-fb, and isql (or equivalents
       ending in .exe on Windows).
     - Removed a bunch of inappropriately pasted stuff from the Firebird
       tutorial, and updated it a bit.
     - `HEAD` and `ROOT` are now recognized as aliases for `@HEAD` and
       `@ROOT`, when querying the database, too. That means that `revert --to
       HEAD` now works the same as `revert --to @HEAD`, as had been expected
       in v0.990.
     - Eliminated "use of uninitialized value" warnings when database
       connections fail.
     - Reduced the minimum required DBD::Firebird to v1.11.
     - Fixed the `--verbose` option to the `target` command.
     - Eliminated more user-configuration issues in tests, thanks to
       chromatic.
     - Fixed test failures when the `$PGPASSWORD` environment variable is set,
       thanks to Ioan Rogers's test smoker.

0.990  2014-01-04T01:14:24Z
     [New Features]
     - Added new command and feature: `target`. Use it to manage multiple
       database targets, each with an associated URI and, optionally, a
       registry name and command-line client. Inspired by Git remotes.
     - Added Firebird engine. Three cheers to Ștefan Suciu for this
       contribution!
     - Added support for the generation of arbitrary scripts from templates to
       the `add` command. Just add template files to subdirectories of the
       `templates` directory, and scripts will be created in a directory of
       the same name based on those templates.
     - Added `--open-editor` option (and aliases) to the `add` and `rework`
       commands. This option will open the newly-added change scripts in the
       preferred editor. Thanks to Thomas Sibley for the patch!

     [Improvements]
     - Improved database driver loading to ensure the proper version of the
       driver is required.
     - Non-fatal but possibly unexpected messages -- which correspond to exit
       value 1 -- now send their messages to STDOUT instead of STDERR, and
       respect the `--quiet` option. Thanks to @giorgio-v for the report!
     - Added or replaced the `--target` option to commands that connect to a
       database to specify the name of target managed by the new `target`
       command or a database URI.
     - `HEAD` and `ROOT` are now recognized as aliases for `@HEAD` and
       `@ROOT`, respectively, since they are disallowed as change names,
       anyway, and folks often use them out of habit from Git.

     [Internals]
     - Replaced the engine-specific connection attributes with three
       attributes use by every engine:
       * `target`: The name of a target managed by the new `target` command.
         Defaults to a value stored for the `core.$engine.target`
         configuration variable. If that variable does not exist, the target
         falls back on the stringification of `uri`.
       * `uri`: a database URI with the format `db:{engine}:{dbname}` or
         `db:{engine}://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{dbname}`. If its
         value is not passed to the constructor, a `uri` value is looked up
         for the associated `target`. If `target` is not passed or configured,
         or if it has no URI associated with it, the `config.$engine.uri`
         configuration variable is used. If that value does not exist, the URI
         defaults to `db:$engine:`. In any of these cases, if any of the
         `--db-*` options are passed, they will be merged into the URI.
       * `registry`: the name to use for the Sqitch registry schema or
         database, where Sqitch's own data will be stored, as appropriate to
         each engine. If its value is not passed to the constructor, a
         `registry` value is looked up for the associated `target`. If
         `target` is not passed or configured, or if it has no registry
         associated with it, the `config.$engine.registry` configuration
         variable is used. If no value is found there, it defaults to an
         engine-specific value, usually "sqitch".

     [Bug Fixes]
     - Fixed a bug when installing under local::lib. Thanks to Thomas Sibley
       for the pull request!
     - Eliminated "Wide character in print" warnings when piping the `log`
       command.
     - Documented that reworked changes do not have their verify tests run by
       the `verify` command. They do run when using the `--verify` deploy
       option.
     - Removed the documentation for the `add.with_deploy`, `add.with_revert`,
       and `add.with_verify` configuration variables, which were never
       implemented.

     [Deprecations]
     - Deprecated engine-specific connection attributes and configuration
       variables. See the "Internals" section for their replacements. The
       deprecated options are:
       * `core.$engine.username`
       * `core.$engine.password`
       * `core.$engine.db_name`
       * `core.$engine.host`
       * `core.$engine.port`
       * `core.$engine.sqitch_schema`
       * `core.$engine.sqitch_db`
     - Deprecated all command-specific options with the string "target" in
       them, such as `--to-target`, `--upto-target`, etc. They have been
       replaced with options containing the string "change", instead, such as
       `--to-change` and `--upto-change`. Few people used these options,
       preferring their shorter aliases (`--to`, `--upto`, etc.).
     - Deprecated the `--deploy-template`, `--revert-template`, and
       `--verify-template` options to the `add` command. They are replaced
       with a single option, `--use` which takes a key/value pair for the
       script name and template path. This makes it useful for arbitrary
       script generation, as well.
     - Deprecated the `--deploy`, `--revert`, and `--verify` options to the
       `add` command, as well as their `--no-*` variants. They are replaced
       with two new options, `--with` and `--without`, to which a script name
       is passed. These are useful for arbitrary script generation, as well.
     - Deprecated the `add.deploy_template`, `add.revert_template`, and
       `add.verify_template` configuration settings. They have been replaced
       with a section, `add.templates`, which is more general, and supports
       arbitrary script generation, as well.

     [Incompatibilities]
     - Removed the undocumented `--test` option to the `add` command.
     - Changed the meaning of `--target` from specifying a change to
       specifying a deployment target. Use the new `--change` option to
       specify a change.

0.983  2013-11-21T21:50:12Z
     - Fixed "Use of uninitialized value" in the MySQL engine. Thanks to
       Jean-Michel REY for the report.
     - All tests now protect against failures due to the presence of the
       `$SQITCH_CONFIG` environment variable (issue #114).
     - The installer now respects the `distdir` option to `Build.PL` when
       searching for existing templates. Important for packaging.
     - Fixed the error "Table 'sqitch.changes' doesn't exist" when deploying
       to a MySQL database that exists but has not been initialized. Thanks to
       Jean-Michel REY for the report!
     - Refactored the handling of the C<--log-only> option so it sets an
       engine attribute, rather than passing the flag to a whole stack of
       method calls.
     - Fixed "Argument "en_us" isn't numeric" error on Windows.
     - Now using `LC_ALL` instead of `LC_MESSAGES` when setting the locale, as
       the latter is not present on Windows.
     - The sqitch-pg RPM now requires DBD::Pg 2.0.0 or higher.
     - Improved handling of invalid command names so that the error message is
       less ambiguous when triggered by a Perl parse error.
     - Added `-m` as an alias for `--note`, for you Git folks out there.
     - Added exception handling to the Postgres and Oracle engines to avoid
       unexpected errors when deploying to a database that has not been
       deployed to before.
     - Updated detection of an uninitialized database to double-check with the
       engine that it really thinks it's uninitialized, not just that the
       "changes" table is missing. This should catch the case where the
       database has its own "changes" table unrelated to Sqitch.

0.982  2013-09-11T18:26:07Z
     - Errors thrown by Template toolkit are no longer silently ignored.
     - Variables passed to change templates are now cloned before the
       execution of each template. This prevents one template from deleting
       variable values another template might also need.
     - Fixed "The getpwnam function is unimplemented" errors on Win32.
     - No longer runs revert scripts when deploying with `--log-only` and a
       verify script fails, as that could lead to data loss (yikes!). Thanks
       to BryLo for the report (issue #112).

0.981  2013-09-06T00:22:26Z
     - Now use Encode::Locale to try to decode the user's full name from the
       system encoding when fetched from the system on all OSes. Note that
       this is not necessary if the `user.name` config is explicitly set, as
       recommended. Issue #107.
     - Removed the special-case handling of the user's full name fetched from
       the system on OS X.
     - Added call to `sleep` to test in an attempt to fix SQLite failures.
     - The SQLite engine now requires that the SQLite client be 3.3.9 or
       later, for support of the `-bail` option.
     - Bug fix: The MySQL engine now properly uses the host, port, and
       password options when connecting to the database. Thanks to vreb87 for
       the report!

0.980  2013-08-28T21:40:00Z
     - Changed the default SQLite Sqitch database name from
       `$dbname-sqitch.$suffix` to `sqitch.$suffix`. The `$suffix` still
       comes from the destination database name. This breaks compatibility
       with previous releases. If you need the old name, set it with
       `sqitch config core.sqlite.sqitch_db $dbname`.
     - Fixed encoding of the user's full name when fetched from the system on
       OS X. Thanks to Tomohiro Hosaka for the pull request!
     - Fixed test failures when DBD::SQLite is installed but compiled with
       SQLite 3.7.10 or lower.
     - Fixed a bug where declaring a dependency on a reworked change would
       incorrectly result in the error "Key "foo" matches multiple changes".
       Thanks to BryLo for the report (issue #103).
     - Modified tests to allow them to run in parallel without stomping on
       each other.
     - Bundling of options, such as `-vvv`, now works properly (issue #108).
     - Added alias `--get-regexp` for `--get-regex` to the `config` command.
       This brings it in line with the documentation for the `config` command
       (Issue #110).
     - Fixed all of the `config` command actions that contain a dash so that
       they actually work. Thanks to Ștefan Suciu for the report (issue #110).
     - All leading and trailing white space is now trimmed from plan notes,
       rather than just vertical white space. Thanks to Ronan Dunklau for the
       report (issue #106).
     - The `status` command now notices if the specified database is
       uninitialized and says as much, rather than dying with an SQL error
       (issue #109).
     - When reading the user's username from the system Sqitch now uses
       Encode::Locale to try to decode the value from the system encoding.
       Issue #107.
     - Compatibility change: Changed the location and name of script template
       files. Previously they were called `deploy.tmpl`, `revert.tmpl`, and
       `verify.tmpl`, and they lived in the `templates` subdirectory of the
       system-wide and user-specific configuration directories. They now live
       in subdirectories of the `templates` directory named for each action
       (deploy, revert, and verify), and with file names matching engine names
       (`pg.tmpl`, `sqlite.tmpl`, `oracle.tmpl`, and `mysql.tmpl`). The
       installer will move old files from the system-wide config directory
       (`sqitch --etc-path`) to their new homes, named `pg.tmpl` and
       `sqlite.tmpl`. It assumes no customizations exist for Oracle. If that's
       not true in your case, simply copy the `pg.tmpl` files to
       `oracle.tmpl`.
     - Added the `--template-name` option to the `add` command. By default, it
       looks for templates named for the current engine. The option allows for
       the user of task-specific templates. For example, if you create
       templates named `createtable.tmpl` in the `deploy`, `revert`, and
       `verify` subdirectories of `~/.sqitch/templates`, You can specify
       `--template-name createtable` to use those templates when adding a
       change.
     - Added the `--exists` option to the `show` command.
     - Fixed the `--set` option to the `add` command so that duplicate keys
       have their values passed to the template as an array, as documented.
     - If Template::Toolkit is installed, the `add` command will use it for
       processing templates instead of Template::Tiny. This makes it easy to
       upgrade the templating environment just by installing a module.

0.973  2013-07-03T13:47:22Z
     - Now Require DBD::SQLite compiled with SQLite 3.7.11 or higher. It
       always has, but now it throws a meaningful exception if an older
       version is compiled into DBD::SQLite. Thanks to Damon Buckwalter for
       the report.
     - When a deploy fails because of missing dependencies, the list of
       missing dependencies no longer contains duplicates. Thanks to Damon
       Buckwalter for the report.

0.972  2013-05-31T23:26:52Z
     - Fixed test failures on Windows.
     - Fixed locale configuration on Windows so that `sqitch` will actually
       run, rather than exiting with an error about `LC_MESSAGES` not being
       set.
     - Fixed a test hang on Windows when DBD::Oracle is installed but the
       Oracle libraries (`OCI.dll`) are not or cannot be found. This was
       triggering a UI dialog that did not dismiss itself. Using Win32::API
       to work around this issue. Thanks to Jan Dubois for the fix.

0.971  2013-05-18T21:08:51Z
     - Removed most uses of the smartmatch operator, since as of Perl 5.17.11
       it is marked as experimental, and silenced the warning where it is
       still used.
     - Added 0.1s sleep between logging changes back-to-back in the engine
       tests, mostly to try to get SQLite to generate different timestamps.
       Pretty sure the recent test failures have been due to the passage of
       less than a millisecond between the two inserts.
     - Added the `shell` and `quote_shell` methods to Sqitch.pm for shelling
       out a command.
     - Sqitch now shells out to an editor when opening a file for the user to
       edit. For example, if the `$EDITOR` environment variable is set to
       `"emacs -nw"`, it will now work. Thanks to Florian Ragwitz for the
       report (issue #80).
     - Removed the pod-checking tests from the distribution.

0.970 2013-05-09T00:21:06Z
     - Fixed the default ordering of changes displayed by the `plan` command.
       They are now ascending by default.
     - Switched to PerlIO::utf8_strict for fast character encoding and
       decoding.
     - The help emitted when an unknown option is passed to `sqitch` now
       consists of a usage statement and brief table of options, rather than
       the entire man page.
     - Added the project name in a header to the output of the `plan` command.
     - Added the Oracle engine.
     - Added `sqitchtutorial-oracle.pod`, a Oracle-specific variant of
       `sqitchtutorial.pod`.
     - Added missing version declaration to the App::Sqitch::Plan::* modules.
     - Devel::StackTrace 1.30 is now properly required (it was previously
       recommended).
     - The `--show-tags` and `--show-changes` options to the `status` command
       now show the changes when the project plan cannot be found (issue #90).

0.965  2013-04-23T16:25:59Z
     - Fixed failing test due to line-ending character variations on Windows.
       Many thanks to Jan Dubois for the testing help.
     - Replaced all uses of `$/` in output to `"\n"`. Thanks to Jan Dubois for
       pointing out the incorrect use of `$/`.
     - Fixed build error that prevented installation on Perl 5.10 when the
       parent module was not installed.

0.964  2013-04-15T18:47:30Z
     - Fixed test failures on Perl versions lower than 5.14 when DBD::SQLite
       or DBD::Pg is not installed.
     - Removed DBD::SQLite from the list of build dependencies.
     - Fixed test failures due to encoded (wide-character) warnings on
       triggered on systems with non-english locales. Thanks to Alexandr
       Ciornii for the smoke testing that revealed this issue.
     - Removed overriding of Throwable's `previous_exception` in
       App::Sqitch::X on Throwable 0.200007 and higher, where it is no longer
       needed.
     - Changed test comparing file contents that fails on Windows to do a
       looser comparison and hopefully fix the test failure.

0.963  2013-04-12T19:11:29Z
     - Fixed a test failure when Git is in the execution path and the test is
       not run from a Git checkout.
     - Added `plan` to `sqitchchanges`, the contents of which are shown when
       Sqitch is run with no command.
     - Removed the unique constraint on tag names in the database, as it
       prevented two projects from having the same tag name. Replaced it with
       a unique constraint on the project and tag names. Folks with production
       PostgreSQL installs should run these queries:
           ALTER TABLE sqitch.tags DROP CONSTRAINT tags_tag_key, ADD UNIQUE(project, tag);
           COMMENT ON COLUMN sqitch.tags.tag IS 'Project-unique tag name.';
     - Fixed failing tests when DBD::SQLite is not installed.
     - Removed dependency on Git::Wrapper. The `checkout` command does things
       very simply, and we already have tools for running command-line
       applications. So we just take advantage of that. The code is no more
       complicated than it was before.
     - Added the `core.vcs.client` configuration setting. Defaults to `git`
       (or `git.exe` on Windows).

0.962  2013-04-10T17:10:05Z
     - Fixed failing test on Perl 5.12 and lower.
     - Fixed the French translation by re-encoding it in UTF-8 (Ronan
       Dunklau).
     - Fixed the loading of the editor with placeholder text to properly
       encode that text as UTF-8 (Ronan Dunklau).

0.961  2013-04-09T19:21:15Z
     - Fixed error when running on PostgreSQL 9.0.
     - Added support for PostgreSQL 8.4.
     - Fixed the SQLite tests to skip the live tests when `sqlite3` cannot be
       found.
     - Fixed the Postgres tests to skip the live tests if `psql` cannot be
       found or cannot connect to the database.
     - Fixed the `checkout` test to skip tests that depend on Git and Git is
       not found in the path.
     - Fixed test failures on Windows (hopefully).
     - Made the order of commented configuration variables in the project
       configuration file deterministic. It will now always be the same order
       as specified by the engine class. This fixes test failures on Perl
       5.17.
     - Fixed encoding issue that caused test failures on Perl 5.17.
     - Requiring Devel::StackTrace 1.30, as earlier versions can
       intermittently suppress errors.
     - Added hack to `App::Sqitch::X::hurl()` to work around a bug in
       Throwable that prevents `previous_exception` from being set half the
       time on v5.17.

0.960  2013-04-05T23:04:35Z
     - Removed `-CAS` from the shebang line on Perl 5.10.0. This is to
       eliminate `Too late for "-CAS" option` errors. This means that UTF-8
       semantics will be suboptimal on Perl 5.10.0. Consider upgrading to 5.12
       or higher.
     - Added the `checkout` command. Pass it the name of a VCS branch, and it
       will compare the plans between that branch and the current branch,
       revert to the last common change, check out the branch, and then
       redeploy. This makes it easy to switch between working branches that
       have different sets of commits. Git-only for now. Idea and code by
       Ronan Dunklau.
     - The `rebase` command no longer fails if the database is already
       reverted, but just makes a note of it and goes on to the deploy.
     - Added the `plan` command. It's like `log`, but shows a list of changes
       in the plan, rather than events recorded in the database.
     - Added `search_changes()` to Plan. Used by the `plan` command.
     - Added the `--oneline` option to the `log` command.
     - Allow tagging of an arbitrary change, not just the last change in the
       plan, by passing a change specification (name, ID, or tag) as the
       second argument to the `tag` command.
     - Updated error messages to note that blank characters are not allowed in
       project, change, or tag names.
     - Factored most of the engine-specific code into
       App::Sqitch::Role::DBIEngine. Future DBI-based engines should be able
       to use this role to handle most of the work.
     - Factored the live engine tests int `t/lib/DBIEngineTest`. Future
       DBI-based engines can use this module to do all or most of the live
       testing.
     - Added the SQLite engine. The Sqitch metadata is stored in a separate
       file from a database, by default in the same directory as the database
       file.
     - Added `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`, a SQLite-specific variant of
       `sqitchtutorial.pod`.

0.953  2013-02-21T23:37:57Z
     - Fixed test failure in `t/engine.t` triggered by a clock tick.
     - Changed the verify template to end with `ROLLBACK` rather than
       `COMMIT`. This it to encourage folks to make no lasting changes in
       verify tests.
     - Fixed exception triggered on an attempt to revert or rebase `--to` a
       change that does not exist in the database.
     - Added recommendation for Pod::Simple to the build process.
     - Added the `--etcdir` build option to specify the directory in which
       configuration and template files should be installed. Defaults to the
       `etc/sqitch` subdirectory of the `--prefix`, `--install_base`, or
       Perl's prefix.
     - Added the `--installed_etcdir` build option. This is used to set
       the location of the system etc directory. Defaults to the value of
       `--etcdir`.
     - When building with `--prefix` or `--install_base`, and without
       `--etcdir`, the configuration files and tmeplates are now installed
       into `etc/sqitch` in that directory, rather than just `etc`. This is to
       enable packaging systems to move the directory to the proper location.

0.952  2013-01-12T00:02:54Z
     - Switched from Moose to Mouse whever possible. Speeds load and runtime
       20-30%. Thanks to Michael Schwern for the pull request!

0.951  2013-01-08T00:21:58Z
     - Fixed double "@" displayed for tags in the output of `revert`.
     - Fixed reversion of reworked changes to run the original revert script,
       rather than the reworked script.
     - Added `is_reworked` accessor to App::Sqitch::Plan::Change.
     - Changed the behavior determining the file name to use for reworked
       change scripts. It now looks for a deploy script using the name of any
       tag between the reworked instances of a change and selects the first
       one it finds that exists. This will allow Sqitch to find the proper
       script name even if new tags have been added to the plan (issue #70).

0.950  2013-01-03T23:09:42Z
     - Fixed the "Name" header in `sqitch-rebase` so that it will actually
       show up on the CPAN search sites.
     - Fixed test failure triggered by the passage of time in `t/engine.t`.
     - At the start of a `deploy`, if the most recently deployed change has
       any unlogged tags (that is, tags added since the last `deploy`), they
       will be logged before the `deploy` continues (issue #60).
     - Added the `--no-log` option to `deploy`, `revert`, and `rebase`. This
       causes the changes to be logged as deployed without actually running
       the deploy scripts. Useful for an existing database that is being
       converted to Sqitch, and you need to log changes as deployed because
       they have been deployed by other means in the past.
     - Now check that dependencies are required for all changes to be deployed
       or reverted before deploying or reverting anything, rather than
       checking dependencies for each change just before deploying or reverting
       it. This allows a or revert deploy to fail sooner, with no database
       changes, when dependencies are not met.
     - The `deploy` command now checks that no changes its about to deploy are
       already deployed.
     - Added `--mode` to the `rebase` command.
     - Added the `--verify` option to `deploy` and `rebase`. Specify this
       option to run the verify script, if it exists, for each change after it
       is deployed. If the verify script dies, the deploy will be considered a
       failure and the requisite reversion (as specified for `--mode`) will
       begin.
     - Added the `verify` command, which verifies that a database is valid
       relative to the plan and each deployed change's verification scripts.
     - Changed the format of the list of changes output by `deploy` and
       `revert` so that each now gets "ok" or "not ok" printed on success or
       failure.
     - Added short aliases for commonly-used core options:
       * -f for --plan-file
       * -v for --verbose
       * -h for --db-host
       * -p for --db-port

0.940  2012-12-04T05:49:45Z
     - Fixed tests that failed due to I18N issues, with thanks to Arnaud
       (Arhuman) ASSAD!
     - Localized messages are now properly encoded in UTF-8. Thanks to Ronan
       Dunklau for the report (issue #46) and to Guido Flohr for details on
       how to address the issue.
     - The variables defined for the `add`, `deploy`, and `revert` commands
       now have the case of there names preserved if Config::GitLike 1.10 or
       later is installed. Thanks to Ronan Dunklau for the report (issue #48)
       and to Alex Vandiver for the case-preserving update to Config::GitLike.
     - Attempting to run `sqitch` with no command now outputs the list of
       supported commands (`sqitchcommands`), rather than the list of core
       options. Thanks to BryLo for the suggestion.
     - Changed the plan parser so that it no longer changes the order of
       changes based on the dependency graph. Unfortunately, this meant that
       the order could change from one run to another, especially if new
       changes were added since the last deploy. The planner now throws an
       exception if the order in the plan is wrong, and suggests that the user
       move changes in the plan file to get it to work properly.
     - Fixed bug where the `core.plan_file` configuration variable was
       ignored.
     - Improved error handling when deploying and reverting a change. If the
       change successfully deployed but the logging of the deployment to the
       database failed, there was just a rollback message. Sqitch will now
       emit the underlying error *and* run the revert script for the
       just-deployed change.
     - Modified the text hashed for change and tag IDs. Both now include the
       note, if present, the ID of the preceding change, and the list of
       dependencies. The result is that, when a change is modified or moved in
       the plan, it gets a new ID ID. The upshot is that things *must* be in
       order for a deploy to succeed. Existing deployments will automatically
       have their IDs updated by the `deploy` command.
     - Changed the `revert` command so that it *only* fetches information about
       changes to be reverted from the database, rather than the plan.
     - Deprecated the `@LAST` and `@FIRST` symbolic tags. With `revert` now
       fetching change information from the database, there is no longer a
       need to specify that changes be found in the database. It's possible
       some other way to search database changes will be added in the future,
       but if so, it will be less limiting than `@LAST` and `@FIRST`, because
       it will likely allow searches by literal tags.
     - Added the `rebase` command. This command combines a `revert` and a
       `deploy` into a single command, which should allow for more natural
       deployment testing during development. `sqitch rebase @HEAD^` should
       become a common command for database developers.
     - Duplicate values passed via `--requires` and `--conflicts` in the `add`
       and `rework` actions are now ignored.
     - The `add` command now throws an exception if `--template-directory` is
       passed or specified in the configuration file, and the specified
       directory does not exist or is not a directory. Thanks to Ronan Dunklau
       for the report! (Issue #52).
     - The `revert` command now prompts for confirmation before reverting
       anything. The prompt can be skipped via the `-y` option or setting the
       `revert.no_prompt` configuration variable. Works for rebase, too, which
       reads `rebase.no_prompt` before `revert.no_prompt`.' (Issue #49.)
     - Added the `show` command, which show information about changes or tags,
       or the contents of change script files. (Issue #57.)
     - Renamed the `test` scripts and planned command to `verify`.

0.938 2012-10-12T19:16:57Z
     - Added a primary key to the PostgreSQL `events` table, which should make
       it easier to support replication.

0.937 2012-10-09T21:54:36Z
     - Fixed the `--to` option to `deploy` and `revert`, which was ignored
       starting in v0.936.

0.936 2012-10-09T19:11:5Z2
     - Added `--set` option to the `deploy` and `revert` commands. Useful for
       setting database client variables for use in scripts. Used by the
       PostgreSQL engine.
     - Merged the contents of `dist/sqitch-pg.spec` into a subpackage in
       `sqitch.spec`. This allows both RPMs are created from a single build
       process. Simplifies things quite a bit and improves the flexibility for
       adding other engines in the future.
     - Reduced required Perl version from 5.10.1 to 5.10.0.
     - Fixed inconsistent handling of command options with dashes where some
       were ignored.
     - The bundle command now properly copies scripts for changes with slashes
       in their names -- that is, where the scripts are in subdirectories.

0.935 2012-10-02T19:21:05Z
     - Updated `dist/sqitch-pg.spec` to require `postgresql` rather than
       "postgresql91". The version doesn't matter so much.
     - All known Windows issues and failures fixed, with many thanks to Randy
       Stauner for repeatedly running tests and supplying patches:
       - Fixed "'2' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
         operable program or batch file" error on Windows.
       - Fixed multiple errors detecting Windows. The OS name is "MSWin32",
         not "Win32". The test failure thus addressed was the setting of the
         DateTime locale.
       - Fixed failing tests that were incorrectly comparing subprocess errors
         messages on Windows
       - Fixed bug in `bundle` where a file would be re-copied even if the
         source and destination had the same timestamps, as they seem to do
         during tests on Windows. Patch from Randy Stauner.
       - Fixed failing test that failed to include `.exe` in a file name on
         Windows. Patch from Randy Stauner.
     - Added French translation, with thanks to Arnaud (Arhuman) ASSAD!

0.934 2012-09-28T16:43:43Z
     - Fixed typo in error handling that prevented an I/O error message from
       being properly emitted.

0.933 2012-09-27T18:04:53Z
     - The `init` command no longer fails if `--top-dir` does not exist. It
       creates it.
     - Yet another attempt to fix "List form of pipe open not implemented" bug
       on Windows.

0.932 2012-09-26T21:32:48Z
     - One more attempt to fix "List form of pipe open not implemented" bug on
       Windows.

0.931 2012-09-25T19:09:14Z
     - Now properly require Text::LocaleDomain 1.20.
     - Stubbed out French and German localization files. Translators wanted!
     - Added LocaleTextDomain dzil support (no impact on distribution).
     - Fix "List form of pipe open not implemented" bug on Windows by using
       Win32::ShellQuote to quote commands.

0.93  2012-08-31T22:29:41Z
     - Added forward and reverse change references. Append ^ to a change
       reference to mean the change before, or ~ to mean the change following.
       Use ~~ and ^^ to select two changes forward and back, and ~n and ^n,
       where n is an integer, to select that number of changes forward or
       back. Idea stolen from Git, though the meanings of the characters are
       different.
     - Added the @FIRST and @LAST symbolic references to refer to the first
       and last changes deployed to the database, respectively. These vary
       from the existing @ROOT and @HEAD symbolic references, which refer to
       the first and last changes listed in the plan.
     - Updated the tutorial to use the new symbolic references and ^ and ~
       qualifiers where appropriate.
     - The messages output by the `deploy` and `revert` commands now show the
       resolved name of the `--to` target, rather than the value passed to
       `--to`. This is most useful when using a symbolic reference, so you
       can see what you're actually deploying or reverting to.

0.922 2012-08-30T17:41:59Z
     - Loosened constraint to disallow only `/[~^/=%]/` before digits at the
       end of name. This allows, for example, a tag to be named "v1.2-1".
     - Added the `bundle` command to the documentation displayed by `sqitch
       help`.
     - Updated the mention of the `bundle` command in the main `sqitch`
       documentation.

0.921 2012-08-30T00:09:56Z
     - Made Win32::Locale required only on Windows.
     - Fixed some module minimum version requirements so that dependencies
       will be properly listed in `Build.PL`.

0.92  2012-08-28T23:14:37Z
     - Added the `bundle` command.
     - Attempts to deploy a project with a different name or URI than
       previously registered now throws an exception.
     - Added UNIQUE constraint to `projects.uri` in the PostgreSQL Sqitch
       schema.
     - Added ON UPDATE actions to foreign key constraints in the PostgreSQL
       Sqitch schema.

0.913  2012-08-28T17:31:29Z
     - Fixed oversight in test that still relied on `$ENV{USER}` instead of
       `Sqitch->sysuser`,

0.912 2012-08-27T21:23:19Z
     - Fall back on `Sqitch->sysuser` when looking for the PostgreSQL user,
       rather than just `$ENV{USER}`. The method does a lot more work to find
       the system user name. This will hopefully also fix test failures on
       systems where `$ENV{USER}` is not set.
     - Use Win32::Locale to set the locale on DateTime objects on Windows.

0.911 2012-08-23T19:19:17Z
     - Fixed more platform-specific test failures in `t/base.t`.
     - Increased liklihood of finding a user's full name on Windows. Thanks to
       H. Merijn Brand for testing.

0.91  2012-08-23T00:37:36Z
     - Moved `requires` and `conflicts` array columns from the `changes` table
       to an new table, `dependencies`, where there is just one per row.
     - Requirements are now checked before reverting a change. If the change
       is depended on by other changes, it will not be reverted (Issue #36).
     - Fixed bug where the `status` command would show changes and/or tags
       from other projects when `--show-tags` or `--show-changes` were used.
     - Fixed test failures on Windows.
     - Added more ways to look up the current username to minimize the chances
       that none is found.
     - Added Windows-specific way of finding the current user's full name,
       since the existing approach died on Windows.
     - Windows-specific modules are no longer required, but are recommended on
       Windows. They will be listed by `./Build` and added to the "recommends"
       section of the the generated `MYMETA.*` files on Windows.
     - Fixed a bug where dependencies on other projects would be rejected
       in calls to `add` and `rework`.

0.902 2012-08-20T21:14:08Z
     - Fixed another occasional test failure due to a clock tick in `t/pg.t.`
     - Fixed test failures in `t/status.t` on systems without DBD::Pg.

0.901 2012-08-20T19:31:03Z
     - Fix test failure in `t/status.t` caused by failing to ignore a
       pre-existing `~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf` configuration file.
     - Eliminated "Use of uninitialized value in length" warnings.

0.90  2012-08-18T00:05:41Z
     - Added `dist/sqitch.spec`. This file was created to generate an RPM for
       CentOS 6.1.
     - Added `dist/sqitch-pg.spec` to use for creating RPMs for Sqitch with
       PostgreSQL support.
     - Fixed an occasional test failure due to a clock tick in `t/pg.t.`
     - Switched to Dist::Zilla for creating the distribution. For end-users,
       this just means that `Build.PL` is now a generated file.
     - Required module versions are now declared in code. This is so that they
       are enforced at runtime, and also so that they will be picked up by
       Dist::Zilla for inclusion in the generated `Build.PL` and `META` files.x
     - Added support for declaring dependencies (required and conflicting
       changes) from other Sqitch projects. This allows one project to depend
       on changes from another. The syntax is `--requires $projname:$change`.
       This use of the colon required a few changes to the Plan syntax:
       + Pragmas may now appear only in the first "header" section of the
         plan, separated from the changes in the "body" of the plan by a blank
         line.
       + Required dependencies no longer begin with ":". Conflicts still must
         begin with "!".
       + Object names may no longer contain ":", as it is used for project
         specification.
       + Project-qualified dependencies are supported by the project name
         appearing before the change name, separated by a colon.
     - Added App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend, an object to parse, represent, and
       serialize dependencies.
     - The plan parser does not validate changes required from other projects,
       as it has no access to the plans from those projects.
     - The engine interface validates cross-project dependencies before
       deploying changes.
     - Project data is not included in the Sqitch metadata tables in the
       database. There is a table for all known projects, as well as foreign
       key references in the `changes`, `tags`, and `events` tables.
     - Project information is now displayed in the output of `sqitch status`
       and `sqitch log` (in some formats).
     - Added `--project` option to `sqitch status` to identify the project for
       which to display the status. Defaults to the current project, if there
       is one, or to the project in the database, if there is only one
       registered project.
     - Added `--project` option to `sqitch log` to allow searching for events
       from projects matching a regular expression.
     - Now require Config::GitLike 1.09 for its improved character encoding
       support.
     - Dependencies can now be declared as SHA1 hash IDs, including for IDs
       from other projects.
     - Fixed change and tag name validation to count "_" as a non-punctuation
       character, and therefore able to be used at the beginning or end of
       names.
     - Replaced the `appuser` change in `sqitchtutorial` with `appschema`.
       This simplifies things, since users are global objects in PostgreSQL,
       while schemas are not. As a result, a bunch of irrelevant code was
       removed from the tutorial.

0.82  2012-08-03T21:25:27Z
     - Now require Moose 2.0300, since MooseX::Role::Parameterized, which
       requires Role::HasMessage, requires it, anyway,
     - Fixed test failure in `t/pg.t` when running on Test::More 0.94.
     - Require POSIX in `t/datetime.t` to fix test failure with CentOS 6
       Perl. Not sure why it did not fail anywhere else, but it's harmless
       enough to make sure it's loaded early.

0.81  2012-08-03T11:34:46Z
     - Removed wayward `/l` from a regular expression, which breaks Perls
       earlier than 5.14, and is not needed anyway.
     - Fixed error in `log` that caused invalid output on Perls earlier than
       5.14. Seems that `return` is required for `when` statements meant to
       return a value, and postfix `when` is not supported in Perl 5.10.

0.80  2012-08-01T21:54:00Z
     - Added the `log` command to `sqitchcommands.pod`, which is shown as the
       output of `sqitch help`.
     - Added  `user.name` and `user.email` configuration variables.
     - Now using `user.name` and `user.email`, rather than the system or
       database user name, to log the user committing changes to a database.
     - Database-specific options are now prefixed with `--db-`.
     - Added "raw" format to App::Sqitch::DateTime. It is ISO-8601 format in
       UTC.
     - Modified the "raw" log format to use the raw DateTime format.
     - Added timestamp and planner info to the plan. This is additional
       metadata included in every change and tag: The planner's name and email
       address and the current timestamp. This makes it easier to audit who
       added changes to a plan and when.
     - Added the `--note` option to the `add`, `rework`, and `tag` commands.
     - For consistency throughout, renamed all attributes and options from
       "message" and "comment" to "note", which is shorter and better reflects
       their purpose.
     - The planner's name and email address, as well as the plan time and
       note, are now stored in the database whenever changes or tags are
       committed and logged.
     - Renamed various database columns to be more consistent, with the terms
       "commit", "plan", and "note".
     - Added `requires` and `conflicts` columns to the events table, so that
       they can become available to the `log` command.
     - Various `log` format changes:
       * Renamed %n (newline) to %v (vertical space)
       * Renamed %c to %n (change name)
       * Replaced %a (committer name) with %c (committer info). It takes an
         optional argument:
         + "name" or "n" for committer name
         + "email" or "e" for committer email
         + "d" or "date" for commit date
         + "d:$format" or "date:$format" for formatted commit date
       * Added %p (planner info). It takes an optional argument just like
         "%c" does:
         + "name" or "n" for planner name
         + "email" or "e" for planner email
         + "d" or "date" for plan date
         + "d:$format" or "date:$format" for formatted plan date
       * Added special argument to "%C", `:event", which returns a color based
         on the value of the event type:
         + Green for "deploy"
         + Blue for "revert"
         + Red for "fail"
       * Added "%r" and "%R" for lists of required changes.
       * Added "%x" and "%X" for lists of conflicting changes.
       * Added "%a" to display an unlocalized attribute name and value.
       * Added "planner", "committer", "planned", and "email" arguments to %_.
       * Documented that the dates can take CLDR or strftime formats, too.
       * Added the %s, %b, and %B format for "subject", "body", and raw body
         akin to Git. The values are taken from the note value, if available.
       * Added committer email addresses to default formats.
       * Added plan data to default formats.
       * Added note data to default formats.
       * Added lists of required and conflicting changes to the "raw" and
         "full" formats.
       * Switched to event-driven colors for event types and change IDs in
         default formats.
       * Added color to the event type and change ID output in the "raw"
         format.
    - Added detailed descriptions of the default formats to `sqitch-log.pod`.
    - Updated the Change object to encode and decode vertical whitespace in a
      note, so that all data remains on a single line for each object in the
      plan file.
    - Now require a note when adding, reworking, or tagging a change. If
      `--note` is not specified, an editor will be launched and the user
      prompted to write a note. This is similar to how `git commit` behaves,
      and encourages documentation of changes.
    - Added required "project" and optional "uri" pragmas to the plan.
    - Added `--project` and `--uri` attributes to the `init` command.
    - Removed the `core.uri` configuration variable and corresponding core
      `--uri` option (since it has been replaced with the `init` command's
      `--uri` option.
    - Command-line arguments are now all assumed to be UTF-8, and are parsed
      as such.
    - Added workaround to force the configuration file to be written and read
      as UTF-8. Requires an unreleased version of Config::GitLike to actually
      work properly.
    - Text passed to a pager (as when running `sqitch log`) is now encoded in
      UTF-8.
    - Fixed `--quiet` option so that it properly trumps `--verbose`.

0.71  2012-07-12T15:30:27Z
     - Updated the example `sqitch log` output in `sqitchtutorial`.
     - Changed the terms "actor", "agent" to "committer" throughout the API
       and output.
     - Renamed the `events` table columns from `logged_at` and `logged_by` to
       `committed_at` and `committed_by`.

0.70  2012-07-12T13:24:13Z
     - Changed the `current_changes()` and `current_tags()` Engine methods so
       that they return iterator code references instead of lists.
     - Added the `search_events()` Engine method, to search the event log.
     - Added the `pager` attribute and `page()` methods to App::Sqitch.
     - Added support for `strftime:` and `cldr:` options to the `status`
       command's `--date-format` option.
     - Added the `log` command.
     - Added the `strftime:$string` and `cldr:$string` options to
       `--date-format` in the `status` and `log` commands.

0.60  2012-07-07T11:12:26Z
     - Removed some discussion of VCS integration, since it is not yet
       implemented, and it may be a while before it is.
     - Added `sqitchcommands`, documentation of the most common Sqitch
       commands, and fixed `--help` to show it.
     - Fixed `--man` to show the sqitch command documentation.
     - Fixed error handling for unknown commands, so that it displays a
       message saying the command is unknown, rather than a stack trace.
     - Adding a change after a tag now also inserts a blank line into the plan
       between the tag and the new change, for nicer plan file formatting.
     - Added the `status` command.
     - Added App::Sqitch::DateTime, a DateTime subclass with named formats.

0.51  2012-07-04T18:34:07Z
     - Added Role::HasMessage to the list or requirements in `Build.PL`. Was
       an oversight that it was omitted in v0.50.
     - Removed the `--dry-run` option. It was completely ignored. Maybe it
       will return someday.
     - Removed `fail()`, `bail()`, `unfound()`, and `help()`. It's better for
       commands not to exit, so have them throw exceptions in the appropriate
       places, instead.
     - Replaced all uses of Carp and non-exception handling uses of `die` with
       our own localized exceptions.
     - Localized all output and exception messages.

0.50  2012-07-03T19:55:20Z
     - Require a plan file.
     - Renamed "steps" to "changes".
     - New plan file spec.
       + Tags are just labels on a particular change, no longer a list of
         changes.
       + Dependencies now specified in the plan file, not in the deploy
         script.
       + Changes can be specified as deploys or reverts, though reverts
         are not currently supported.
       + Changes can be specified with an optional leading `+` for deploy or
         `-` for revert, which will eventually be important for conflict
         management.
       + Dependencies can be specified as other change names, tags, or a
         change as of a tag (e.g., `foo@beta`).
       + Pragmas can be specified with a leading `%`. Only `%syntax-version`
         is currently recognized; all others are ignored.
     - Renamed the `add-step` command to just `add`.
     - Added the `tag` command.
     - Added the `revert` command.
     - Added the `rework` command.
     - Added exception objects and started using them.
     - Added localization support and started using it.
     - Added IDs to changes and tags. These are SHA1s generated from the return
       value of the new `info` method, which describes the change or tag.
     - Updated the PostgreSQL engine to comply with the new Engine API.
     - Updated the PostgreSQL engine to use IDs for tracking changes and tags.
     - Eliminated the term "node" from the plan implementation and docs.
     - Updated the engine base class for the new plan API, and to just deploy
       changes one-at-a-time.
     - Added many new ways to look for changes in the plan, including:
       + `change_name`
       + `@tag_name`
       + `change_name@tag_name`
       + `change_id`
       + `tag_id`
     - The plan file can now be written out with nearly all white space and
       comments preserved.
     - Changed the `add` command to write out the plan file after a new change
       is added.
     - Change names can now be duplicated, as long as a tag name appears
       between them.
     - Renamed `target` to destination in Engine.
     - Started referring to the change to deploy or revert to in docs as the
       "target".
     - PostgreSQL errors will now be thrown as Sqitch exceptions, for proper
       handling during command execution.
     - Added required `core.uri` configuration setting. Used to keep change
       IDs unique across projects.
     - Added `--mode` option to `deploy`, to trigger reverts on failure to
       either:
       + Not at all: keep the latest successful change.
       + To the last deployed tag
       + To the point at which the current deploy started
     - Added the implicit tags `@ROOT` and `@HEAD` for looking up changes in
       the plan.
     - Renamed `sql_dir` to `top_dir` and made it default to the current
       directory.
     - Changed the location of the plan file to the top directory. This will
       make it easier to have plans and scripts for multiple database
       platforms in a single project.
     - Fixed a bug in the build process so that template files will be
       properly written to the `etc` directory.
     - Rewrote `sqitchtutorial` to reflect the new realities.
     - Updated `sqitch` documentation, and moved the plan file information to
       App::Sqitch::Plan.

0.31  2012-05-21T22:29:42Z
     - Fixed some typos and failing tests.

0.30  2012-05-18T15:43:12Z
     - The `init` command now properly writes out the `[core]` section header
       when there are only commented core settings.
     - The `--requires` and `--conflicts` options to `add` now work
       properly.
     - Fixed anticipated Win32 test failures in `t/init.t`.'
     - Fixed the `--plan-file`, `--top-dir`, and other directory options so
       that they no longer throw errors, but actually work.
     - Implemented the plan parser. It's designed to later be subclassed to
       support VCS integration. Includes dependency parsing and sorting.
     - Switched to IPC::System::Simple instead for system/capture code.
     - Implemented Engine interface for deploying and reverting tags.
     - Implemented PostgreSQL engine. It uses a lock to ensure that only one
       deployment can run at any time.
     - Added the `deploy` command. it is now possible to deploy to a
       PostgreSQL database.

0.20  2012-05-01T02:48:47Z
     - Added `--local` option to `sqitch config`.
     - Renamed `project_file()` to `--local_file()` in App::Sqitch::Config.
     - `sqitch init` now writes core and engine config settings with default
       values to the configuration file. This makes it easier for folks to get
       started editing it.
     - Implemented `add` command. Includes support for system-wide or
       use-specific templates using Template::Tiny.
     - Added `etc` directory with default templates. This is installed into
       `$Config{prefix}/etc/skitch`, unless built with `--prefix` or
       `--install_base`, in which case it will simply be installed into `etc`
       in that directory.
     - Added `--etc-path`, so that one can know where the system-wide
       configuration and templates are to be found.

0.11  2012-04-27T06:44:54Z
     - Implemented `init` command.
     - Started sketching out the engine interface, with preliminary PostgreSQL
       and SQLite implementations.
     - Require Perl v5.10.1 (did before, but in the wrong place, so it was
       ignored).
     - Fixed test failures on different verions of Moose.
     - Fixed test failure on Perl 5.12.

0.10  2012-04-25T20:46:59Z
      - Initial unstable release.
      - Implemented `help` command.
      - Implemented `config` command, very similar to `git-config`.
