App/Sqitch version 0.996
========================

[![CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/App-Sqitch.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/pl/App-Sqitch)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch)

[Sqitch](http://sqitch.org/) is a database change management application. It
currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4+, SQLite 3.7.11+, MySQL 5.6.4+, Oracle 10g+,
and Firebard 2.0+.

What makes it different from your typical
[migration](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) approaches? A few
things:

*   No opinions

    Sqitch is not integrated with any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it
    is a standalone change management system with no opinions about your
    database engine, application framework, or your development environment.

*   Native scripting

    Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database
    engine. Writing a [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) application? Write
    SQL scripts for
    [`psql`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html).
    Writing an [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/)-backed app?
    Write SQL scripts for [SQL\*Plus](http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SQL*Plus).

*   Dependency resolution

    Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes -- even on
    changes from other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of
    execution, even when you've committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.

*   No numbering

    Change deployment is managed by maintaining a plan file. As such, there is
    no need to number your changes, although you can if you want. Sqitch
    doesn't much care how you name your changes.

*   Iterative Development

    Up until you tag and release your application, you can modify your change
    deployment scripts as often as you like. They're not locked in just
    because they've been committed to your VCS. This allows you to take an
    iterative approach to developing your database schema. Or, better, you can
    do test-driven database development.

  Slides from "Sane Database Management with Sqitch", presented to the
  Portland Perl Mongers in January, 2013.

* [PDXPUG Presentation](https://vimeo.com/50104469): Movie of "Sane Database
  Management with Sqitch", presented to the Portland PostgreSQL Users Group in
  September, 2012.

* [Agile Database Development](https://speakerdeck.com/theory/agile-database-development-2ed):
  Slides from a three-hour tutorial session on using [Git](http://git-scm.org),
  test-driven development with [pgTAP](http://pgtap.org), and change
  management with Sqitch, updated in January, 2014.

Installation
------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch.png)](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch)

To install Sqitch from a distribution download, type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

To build from a Git clone, first install
[Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla), then use it to install
Sqitch and its dependencies:

    cpan Dist::Zilla
    dzil install

To run Sqitch directly from the Git clone execute `t/sqitch`. If you're doing
development on Sqitch, you will need to install the autoring dependencies, as
well:

    dzil listdeps | xargs cpan

To install Sqitch on a specific platform, including Debian- and RedHat-derived
Linux distributions and Windows, see the
[Installation documentation](http://sqitch.org/#installation).
