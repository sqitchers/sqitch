App/Sqitch version 0.990
========================

[Sqitch](http://sqitch.org/) is a database change management application. It
currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4 and higher, SQLite 3.7.11 and higher, MySQL
5.6.4 and higher,, and Oracle 10g and higher.

What makes it different from your typical
[migration](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) approaches? A few
things:

*   No opinions

    Sqitch is not integrated with any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it
    is a standalone change management system with no opinions about your
    database engine, application framework, or your development environment.

*   Native scripting

    Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database
    engine. Writing a [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) application? Write
    SQL scripts for
    [`psql`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html).
    Writing an [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/)-backed app?
    Write SQL scripts for [SQL\*Plus](http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SQL*Plus).

*   Dependency resolution

    Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes -- even on
    changes from other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of
    execution, even when you've committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.

*   No numbering

    Change deployment is managed by maintaining a plan file. As such, there is
    no need to number your changes, although you can if you want. Sqitch
    doesn't much care how you name your changes.

*   Iterative Development

    Up until you tag and release your application, you can modify your change
    deployment scripts as often as you like. They're not locked in just
    because they've been committed to your VCS. This allows you to take an
    iterative approach to developing your database schema. Or, better, you can
    do test-driven database development.

*   Reduced Duplication

    If you're using a VCS to track your changes, you don't have to duplicate
    entire change scripts for simple changes. As long as the changes are
    [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), you can change
    your code directly, and Sqitch will know it needs to be updated.

Installation
------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch.png)](https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch)

To install Sqitch from a distribution download, type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

From a Git clone, first install
[Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla), then use it to install
Sqitch and its dependencies:

    cpan Dist::Zilla
    dzil install

To run Sqitch directly from the Git clone execute `t/sqitch`. If you're doing
development on Sqitch, you will need to install the autoring dependencies, as
well:

    dzil listdeps | xargs cpan
